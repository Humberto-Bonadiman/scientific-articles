Data was also collected using journaling. The data was analyzed using movement and identifying themes in the written data. The results can be summarized in three main themes: boundaries and limitations, polarities and balance and self-care.\nThe main implications of the study are to integrate the explicit use of movement in DMT supervision and self-care practices. Additionally, the practice of sharing one\u2019s cohesive experienced is recommended. For future research, I propose the inclusion of more participants, both DMT interns and therapists and the use of a different artistic medium in the collection of data.M.A., Dance\/Movement Therapy and Counseling -- Drexel University, 201","identifiers":["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6309",null],"publisher":"Drexel University","relations":[],"repositories":[{"id":"2510","openDoarId":0,"name":"Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives","urlHomepage":null,"urlOaipmh":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"roarId":0,"baseId":0,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"repositoryLocation":null}],"repositoryDocument":{"pdfStatus":1,"metadataAdded":1554028642000,"metadataUpdated":1621806154000,"depositedDate":1551277204000},"subjects":["Thesis","Text"],"title":"An Exploration of My Experience as a Dance\/Movement Therapy Intern who worked with Children who have Experienced Trauma: An Artistic Inquiry","topics":["Dance Therapy"],"types":[],"year":201506,"fulltextUrls":["https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/190331523.pdf","https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/display\/190331523","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/1860\/idea:6309","https:\/\/idea.library.drexel.edu\/islandora\/object\/idea%3A6309"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190331523.pdf","oai":"oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6309","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190331523.pdf"},{"id":"190325412","authors":["Bosenbark, Danielle D."],"contributors":["Schultheis, Maria T."],"description":"Background: Despite its recognition as the most frequent form of stroke in children and being a major source of long-standing neurological sequelae, there is a dearth of research concerning the psychosocial and neuropsychological profile of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS). Prior research has documented a high incidence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\u2014a disorder characterized by prominent impairments in attention and executive functioning skills\u2014among children with a history of PAIS, yet there are no prior studies comprehensively investigating this profile in these children. Moreover, medical and neurophysiological factors may contribute to outcomes in these domains are largely understudied in this population. A elevated understanding of the attention and executive functioning profile in PAIS will not only better inform clinicians of the cognitive outcomes, but may also lead to better interventions to address\u2014or strategies for management of\u2014the subsequent sequelae of PAIS. Objectives: The present study sought to: 1) investigate and describe the profile of attention and executive functioning in children following perinatal stroke; and 2) examine the influence of clinical and demographic factors on attention and executive functioning outcomes in children following perinatal stroke. Participants: Forty-one children aged 3-15 diagnosed with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke, recruited from the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Patients were identified through the CHOP Pediatric Stroke Program\u2019s ambulatory patient care clinic and IRB-approved Stroke Registry. Method: Children underwent a single-session neuropsychological assessment focusing on attention and executive functioning domains at CHOP. Additionally, parents\/legal guardians completed questionnaires regarding real-world functioning of attention and executive functioning during the visit as well, providing a functional measure of these domains. Demographic (age, sex, race, and family socioeconomic) and medical variables (lesion size, lesion location, presence of epilepsy) were collected for each participant. Results: Although intellectual performance was in the lower normative range (mean = 94.38; SD = 15.90), it was significantly lower than FSIQ in the normative sample. Additionally, measures of attention, verbal fluency, inhibitory control, flexibility\/shifting, planning\/organizing, and processing speed were significantly lower in children with PAIS than in the normative sample (all p\u003C0.001); working memory was not significantly different. The presence of comorbid epilepsy, larger stroke volume, and older age at time of testing significantly influenced performance on several attention and executive functioning measures, whereas sex, stroke location (anatomical), and stroke laterality did not. Conclusions: Overall, children with PAIS evidenced significant attention and executive functioning impairment in comparison to typically developing peers in the normative population. Children with comorbid epilepsy, larger stroke volume, and\/or older age were at increased risk for deficits in these cognitive domains.Ph.D., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201","identifiers":["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6614",null],"publisher":"Drexel University","relations":[],"repositories":[{"id":"2510","openDoarId":0,"name":"Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives","urlHomepage":null,"urlOaipmh":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"roarId":0,"baseId":0,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"repositoryLocation":null}],"repositoryDocument":{"pdfStatus":1,"metadataAdded":1554028502000,"metadataUpdated":1621806224000,"depositedDate":1551331240000},"subjects":["Text","Thesis"],"title":"Attention and Executive Functioning Profiles in Children Following Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke","topics":["Psychology","Neuropsychology"],"types":[],"year":201506,"fulltextUrls":["https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/190325412.pdf","https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/display\/190325412","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/1860\/idea:6614","https:\/\/idea.library.drexel.edu\/islandora\/object\/idea%3A6614"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190325412.pdf","oai":"oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6614","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190325412.pdf"},{"id":"190322054","authors":["Henry, Racine R."],"contributors":["Hardy, Kenneth V."],"description":"The topics of love and intimate relationships maintain a constant presence in popular and empirical discourse. Romantic relationships in the Black community have been of particular interest in the last decade and several researchers have developed connections between the low rate of Black marriages to the historical enslavement of African people in the United States (Bryant, Taylor, Lincoln, Chatters, \u0026 Jackson, 2008; Cherlin, 1998; Cole \u0026 Omari, 2003; Dickson, 1993; Jones, 2006; Landrine \u0026 Klonoff, 1996; Lawrence-Webb, Littlefield \u0026 Okundaye, 2004; Raley, 1996). Despite the apparent interest in \u0022Black love\u0022, Black men are repeatedly excluded from research studies as viable subjects (Jenkins, 2006; Hurt, 2012; Roberts, 1994). Experiences of racism are prevalent for Black men, as with all Black people, and have extensive ramifications (Bonilla-Silva, 2006; Byrd \u0026 Clayton, 2000, 2002; Feagin \u0026 Spikes, 1994; Jones, 1997; LaVeist, 2002; Pinderhughes, 2002; Utsey \u0026 Ponterotto, 1996; West, 2001). One area, which is significantly impacted by racism, is family formation and, more specifically, the formation and maintenance of healthy partner relationships. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine whether experiences of racism impact desire to get married for never married, heterosexual Black men between age 18 and 45. A survey tool was used to administer two measurements: the Desire to Marry Scale (South, 1993), which measured marriage desirability, and the Schedule of Racist Events (Landrine \u0026 Klonoff, 1996), which measured perceived experiences of racism.

In fact, women are twice as likely as men to experience a mood disorder. Approximately 85% percent of women experience some form of premenstrual symptom exacerbation (PME) and the majority experience symptoms, which are severe enough to interfere with their daily activities. Little is known, however, about the differences in symptom severity, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception among women who experience PME with and without psychiatric comorbidities. In addition, little is known about how psychiatric comorbidities affect severity of PME, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception. Methods: This study was conducted using a comparative descriptive design to compare premenstrual symptoms, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception among women experiencing PME and psychiatric comorbidities to women who experience PME without psychiatric comorbidities. Women with PME were recruited from various nursing organizations using secure online surveys. After collection of socio-demographic information, premenstrual symptom severity was measured with the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST), stress with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), quality of life with the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) and healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception were assessed using the Healthy Lifestyle Questionnaire (HLQ) \u0026 Wellness Self-Perception Scale (WSPS). Data Analysis: The data was cleaned, coded and assessed for outliers and shape of distribution prior to data analysis. Analysis included descriptive statistics to describe key characteristics of the sample, and inferential statistics to test the hypotheses. Results: After controlling for diet, exercise, sleep and caffeine intake, psychiatric comorbidities predicted greater PME symptom severity (\u03b2=0.22; T=2.45; P=0.02), higher perceived stress (\u03b2=0.25; T=2.61; P=0.01), and lower levels of wellness self-perception (\u03b2= -0.30; T= -3.14; P=0.00). Psychiatric comorbidities did not predict quality of life  (\u03b2= -0.13; T= -1.28; P=0.20) or healthy lifestyle (\u03b2= -0.13; T= -1.43; P=0.16). Significance: These findings may inform novel pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions and treatment guidelines to achieve optimal symptom management, reduce stress and improve wellness self-perception among women with PME and psychiatric comorbidities.Dr.N.P., Nursing Practice -- Drexel University, 201","identifiers":["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6723",null],"publisher":"Drexel University","relations":[],"repositories":[{"id":"2510","openDoarId":0,"name":"Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives","urlHomepage":null,"urlOaipmh":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"roarId":0,"baseId":0,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"repositoryLocation":null}],"repositoryDocument":{"pdfStatus":1,"metadataAdded":1554028635000,"metadataUpdated":1621806179000,"depositedDate":1551352851000},"subjects":["Text","Thesis"],"title":"The Continuum of Premenstrual Symptom Exacerbation in Women With and Without Psychiatric Comorbidities: A Nurses\u0027 Health Study","topics":["Nursing","Premenstrual Syndrome"],"types":[],"year":201604,"fulltextUrls":["https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/190331121.pdf","https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/display\/190331121","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/1860\/idea:6723","https:\/\/idea.library.drexel.edu\/islandora\/object\/idea%3A6723"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190331121.pdf","oai":"oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6723","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190331121.pdf"},{"id":"190324420","authors":["Manturuk, Christine L."],"contributors":["Hartzell, Elizabeth"],"description":"The purpose of this phenomenological research study was to explore the lived experience of hallucinations in adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The literature review introduces hallucinations as a symptom of schizophrenia and their related treatment. It presents first-hand accounts of schizophrenia and hallucinations and identifies phenomenological research of schizophrenia and hallucinations. It introduces art therapy use in the case of schizophrenia, and art therapy research of schizophrenia with evidence that there is a lack of qualitative studies of hallucinations in schizophrenia that utilize art as a means of data collection. \n\nTwo participants were recruited for this study from an outpatient mental health facility in Philadelphia, PA. One participant was male and one female. Both identified as African American, were between the ages of 18-55, and had experienced hallucinations related to their diagnosis of schizophrenia. Data was collected through a brief demographic survey, three drawing directives, and an open-ended interview. Art directives included \u201cDraw what the experience of hallucinating is like for you\u201d on a blank page, \u201cConsider this figure an outline of you, and draw the experience of hallucinating in relation to the figure,\u201d on a horizontal or vertical sheet with figure template, and \u201cFill the circle with what you would like to\u201d on a page with mandala template. The open-ended interview focused on thoughts and feelings related to the first experience of hallucinations, content, frequency and modality experienced in, disclosure to others, management and treatment, and what it was like to express the experience in drawing. \n\nData was analyzed using phenomenological research methods outlined by Moustakas (1994). The following aspects were prominent in an analysis of interviews and drawings: 1) Confusion, doesn\u2019t make sense and want to figure it out 2) Desire to escape and to isolate away from others 3) Difficulty in communicating about the experience 4) Extra perceptions in addition to perceptions of a shared reality 5) Flexible and ambiguous content 6) Involvement of different senses and\/or multiple senses 7) Loss of ability to fully orient to a shared reality 8) Loss of autonomy requiring assistance and care 9) Medication and coping strategies 10) Past experiences effect on quality of hallucinations 11) Rarely talked about because of fear of judgment from others 12) Problem and something wrong\/illness\/punishment 13) Unpredictability, sometimes leading to paranoia.\n\nThe synthesis of these aspects suggests that time and space can be altered by the intrusion of hallucinations. They affect most senses and exist as extra perceptions in addition to those that others may share. Hallucinations can be disorienting, confusing, distracting, and scary. The content of hallucinations can vary given past experiences. There can be a desire to figure out the content of the experience. There is also a tendency to want to escape from the experience and also isolate and go away from others. \n\nIt is hard for individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia to communicate about their hallucinations given their complex and bizarre nature. Uncertainty about the experience and fear of stigma contribute to the limitation of expression.\n\nSupport from others is crucial for the health of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia who are experiencing hallucinations. It is relieving for individuals to speak about the experience with someone who they can trust. Mental health professionals, peers, family, friends, can help individuals cope with the experience and stay oriented to a shared reality, treat with medication, be empathetic to loss of autonomy, and explore thoughts of wanting to escape including thoughts of dying.M.A., Art Therapy and Counseling -- Drexel University, 201","identifiers":["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6477",null],"publisher":"Drexel University","relations":[],"repositories":[{"id":"2510","openDoarId":0,"name":"Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives","urlHomepage":null,"urlOaipmh":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"roarId":0,"baseId":0,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"repositoryLocation":null}],"repositoryDocument":{"pdfStatus":1,"metadataAdded":1554028485000,"metadataUpdated":1621806156000,"depositedDate":1551309629000},"subjects":["Thesis","Text"],"title":"The Lived Experience of Hallucinations in Adults with a Diagnosis of Schizophrenia: A Phenomenological Study","topics":["Art Therapy","Hallucinations","Schizophrenia"],"types":[],"year":201509,"fulltextUrls":["https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/190324420.pdf","https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/display\/190324420","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/1860\/idea:6477","https:\/\/idea.library.drexel.edu\/islandora\/object\/idea%3A6477"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190324420.pdf","oai":"oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6477","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190324420.pdf"},{"id":"190321763","authors":["Russon, Jody Moser"],"contributors":["Diamond, Guy S."],"description":"Eating disorders (EDs) and disordered eating represent a serious public health issue among young adolescent and adult populations. EDs are predominately a problem for girls and women. Approximately 90% of people who develop EDs are female (Harvard Health Publications, 2012). Objectification theory (Frederickson \u0026 Roberts, 1997) posits that internalization of sexualized media messages (self-objectification) and social pressures lead to ED behaviors. Not all females exposed to objectifying stimuli experience ED behaviors. This study explored insecurity in family relationships as a risk factor; specifically, whether women who have greater attachment insecurity are more prone to self-objectification and ED-specific attentional bias. Components of Frederickson et al.\u0027s (1998) and Tiggemann \u0026 Boundy\u2019s (2008) experimental designs were replicated. This design has shown that (1) self-objectification can be heightened by context, and (2) self-objectification induces feelings of body shame, which promote ED behaviors. To test attachment insecurity as a risk factor in the objectification framework, a repeated measures experimental design was conducted with women (n = 107), between the ages of 18 and 35. This study utilized a repeated measures, experimental design where each participant either viewed an image set reinforcing the thin-ideal or a control image set of products (no people). Participants were assigned to one of four groups using the minimization method (high attachment insecurity and control images; low attachment insecurity and control images; high attachment insecurity and experimental images; low attachment insecurity and experimental images). Groups were balanced on race, type of insecurity (anxious, avoidant, both), and level of insecurity (over a standard deviation above the mean). The study involved deception in that participants were told that the purpose was to understand women\u2019s attitudes towards advertising. Participants took a screening measure online to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria and then were invited to an in-person session. During in-person data-collection sessions, participants filled out outcome-specific, exploratory and deception self-report measures, viewed the experimental or control image set, and took a cognitive processing test with ED-specific stimuli. Using a factorial MANCOVA, the following hypotheses were tested while controlling for self-esteem (SISE) and parental psychological control (PCS-YSR): 1) Exposure to objectifying stimuli will cause higher levels of state self-objectification (TST) and greater attentional bias towards ED-salient stimuli (ED-specific stroop test); and 2) Exposure to objectifying stimuli will cause higher levels of state self-objectification and greater attentional bias towards ED-salient stimuli for the high attachment insecurity (ECR-RS) group. These hypotheses were tested within a sample of racially and ethnically diverse women. Results demonstrated that those in the high attachment insecurity group demonstrated more attentional bias towards ED-specific stimuli regardless of condition. Implications for family therapists and research limitations are discussed.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201","identifiers":["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6473",null],"publisher":"Drexel University","relations":[],"repositories":[{"id":"2510","openDoarId":0,"name":"Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives","urlHomepage":null,"urlOaipmh":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"roarId":0,"baseId":0,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"repositoryLocation":null}],"repositoryDocument":{"pdfStatus":1,"metadataAdded":1554028442000,"metadataUpdated":1621806156000,"depositedDate":1551309629000},"subjects":["Thesis","Text"],"title":"Objectification Theory and the Family: The Effect of Attachment Insecurity on Self-Objectification and Attentional Bias toward Eating Disorder Stimuli","topics":["Couples Therapy"],"types":[],"year":201508,"fulltextUrls":["https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/190321763.pdf","https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/display\/190321763","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/1860\/idea:6473","https:\/\/idea.library.drexel.edu\/islandora\/object\/idea%3A6473"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190321763.pdf","oai":"oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6473","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190321763.pdf"},{"id":"190329787","authors":["Gorsegner, Amanda"],"contributors":[],"description":"The findings presented in this publication suggest that artists and arts administrators have significant roles to play when using the arts to address climate change.

Women appear particularly vulnerable to these negative effects, whether they are the victims of IPV or the assailants. However, existing interventions to reduce IPV have been tested primarily in men, and appear to be less effective for women perpetrators. Two potential intervention targets for IPV that may be particularly salient for women are problem solving strategies and relationship attachment. Ineffective social problem solving and insecure attachment have been found to be significantly correlated with each other, and have each been associated with an increased likelihood of IPV. The present study examines the relationships among social problem solving, attachment style, and IPV perpetration in a sample of female undergraduate students. It is hypothesized that social problem solving will mediate the relationship between a person\u0027s attachment style and severity of IPV in a romantic relationship. 126 female Drexel undergraduate student volunteers age 18-25 were administered three questionnaires measuring social problem solving (the Social Problem Solving Inventory- Revised), IPV (the Conflict Tactics Scale 2), and attachment (the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised). The questionnaires were completed on Drexel\u0027s SONA system. A bootstrap confidence interval from SPSS\u0027s PROCESS regression analysis, showed that social problem solving partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and IPV but not attachment avoidance.M.S., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201","identifiers":["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6691",null],"publisher":"Drexel University","relations":[],"repositories":[{"id":"2510","openDoarId":0,"name":"Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives","urlHomepage":null,"urlOaipmh":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"roarId":0,"baseId":0,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"repositoryLocation":null}],"repositoryDocument":{"pdfStatus":1,"metadataAdded":1554028510000,"metadataUpdated":1621806224000,"depositedDate":1551352850000},"subjects":["Text","Thesis"],"title":"Attachment, Problem Solving, and Their Role in Relationship Conflicts for Female Perpetrators","topics":["Psychology.","Family Violence.","Spouse Abuse.","Women."],"types":[],"year":201512,"fulltextUrls":["https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/190325772.pdf","https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/display\/190325772","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/1860\/idea:6691","https:\/\/idea.library.drexel.edu\/islandora\/object\/idea%3A6691"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190325772.pdf","oai":"oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6691","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190325772.pdf"},{"id":"190332699","authors":["Sunderaraman, Preeti"],"contributors":["Schultheis, Maria T."],"description":"Difficulty with financial capacity (i.e., difficulty with efficiently managing one\u0027s finances), a common consequence in individuals with moderate to severe brain injury, has been found to affect self-autonomy and limit the individual from fully integrating into the community. Previous studies have found that individuals with brain injury have impaired financial capacity six months post-injury. However, the nature of financial capacity with post-injury periods extending to more than a year has not been studied. Moreover, there is mixed evidence regarding the nature and extent to which different cognitive abilities contribute to financial capacity. Therefore, the current study had three specific aims: (1) To compare the nature of financial capacity in individuals with chronic, moderate to severe acquired brain injury (ABI) with demographically matched controls. (2) To examine the contributions of various cognitive abilities (attention, working memory, executive functions, impulsivity) to financial capacity in the ABI group. (3) To investigate the association between the self-report and informant-report report of financial capacity, in the ABI group. A total of 25 participants with chronic, moderate to severe ABI were recruited from a day-treatment program, and 9 age and education matched-healthy control participants were recruited from the community. All participants were administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to measure cognitive abilities and the Financial Competence Assessment Inventory (FCAI) to assess financial capacity. In addition, 22 informants were interviewed using the Third Party Perspective FCAI. Results indicated that the control group outperformed the ABI group on the overall and the different dimensions of financial capacity. In the ABI group, specific cognitive abilities, including attention, working memory, delayed verbal memory, abstract reasoning and impulsivity contributed to different dimensions of financial capacity. However, no associations were found between ABI- and informant-reports of financial capacity suggesting the confounding presence of a combination of cognitive impairments and biases. These findings shed light on the compromised nature of financial management in ABI individuals years after a brain injury, and underscore the importance of focusing on continued monitoring and rehabilitation of this crucial functional ability.Ph.D., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201","identifiers":["oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6615",null],"publisher":"Drexel University","relations":[],"repositories":[{"id":"2510","openDoarId":0,"name":"Drexel Libraries E-Repository and Archives","urlHomepage":null,"urlOaipmh":null,"uriJournals":null,"physicalName":"noname","source":null,"software":null,"metadataFormat":null,"description":null,"journal":null,"roarId":0,"baseId":0,"pdfStatus":null,"nrUpdates":0,"disabled":false,"lastUpdateTime":null,"repositoryLocation":null}],"repositoryDocument":{"pdfStatus":1,"metadataAdded":1554028674000,"metadataUpdated":1621806225000,"depositedDate":1551331240000},"subjects":["Text","Thesis"],"title":"Financial capacity and neuropsychological performance in acquired brain injury (ABI)","topics":["Clinical Psychology."],"types":[],"year":201609,"fulltextUrls":["https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/pdf\/190332699.pdf","https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/display\/190332699","http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/1860\/idea:6615","https:\/\/idea.library.drexel.edu\/islandora\/object\/idea%3A6615"],"fulltextIdentifier":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190332699.pdf","oai":"oai:idea.library.drexel.edu:idea_6615","downloadUrl":"https:\/\/core.ac.uk\/download\/190332699.pdf"}]}]
