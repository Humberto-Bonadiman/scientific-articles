    "title": "An Exploration of My Experience as a Dance/Movement Therapy Intern who worked with Children who have Experienced Trauma: An Artistic Inquiry",
    "description": "This artistic inquiry asked, what is my experience as a DMT intern who worked with children who have experienced trauma? I was the only participant in the study. The data was collected using the practice of Authentic Movement, which is a codified expressive, improvisational movement process. Data was also collected using journaling. The data was analyzed using movement and identifying themes in the written data. The results can be summarized in three main themes: boundaries and limitations, polarities and balance and self-care.\nThe main implications of the study are to integrate the explicit use of movement in DMT supervision and self-care practices. Additionally, the practice of sharing one’s cohesive experienced is recommended. For future research, I propose the inclusion of more participants, both DMT interns and therapists and the use of a different artistic medium in the collection of data.M.A., Dance/Movement Therapy and Counseling -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Attention and Executive Functioning Profiles in Children Following Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke",
    "description": "Background: Despite its recognition as the most frequent form of stroke in children and being a major source of long-standing neurological sequelae, there is a dearth of research concerning the psychosocial and neuropsychological profile of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS). Prior research has documented a high incidence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)—a disorder characterized by prominent impairments in attention and executive functioning skills—among children with a history of PAIS, yet there are no prior studies comprehensively investigating this profile in these children. Moreover, medical and neurophysiological factors may contribute to outcomes in these domains are largely understudied in this population. A elevated understanding of the attention and executive functioning profile in PAIS will not only better inform clinicians of the cognitive outcomes, but may also lead to better interventions to address—or strategies for management of—the subsequent sequelae of PAIS. Objectives: The present study sought to: 1) investigate and describe the profile of attention and executive functioning in children following perinatal stroke; and 2) examine the influence of clinical and demographic factors on attention and executive functioning outcomes in children following perinatal stroke. Participants: Forty-one children aged 3-15 diagnosed with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke, recruited from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Patients were identified through the CHOP Pediatric Stroke Program’s ambulatory patient care clinic and IRB-approved Stroke Registry. Method: Children underwent a single-session neuropsychological assessment focusing on attention and executive functioning domains at CHOP. Additionally, parents/legal guardians completed questionnaires regarding real-world functioning of attention and executive functioning during the visit as well, providing a functional measure of these domains. Demographic (age, sex, race, and family socioeconomic) and medical variables (lesion size, lesion location, presence of epilepsy) were collected for each participant. Results: Although intellectual performance was in the lower normative range (mean = 94.38; SD = 15.90), it was significantly lower than FSIQ in the normative sample. Additionally, measures of attention, verbal fluency, inhibitory control, flexibility/shifting, planning/organizing, and processing speed were significantly lower in children with PAIS than in the normative sample (all p<0.001); working memory was not significantly different. The presence of comorbid epilepsy, larger stroke volume, and older age at time of testing significantly influenced performance on several attention and executive functioning measures, whereas sex, stroke location (anatomical), and stroke laterality did not. Conclusions: Overall, children with PAIS evidenced significant attention and executive functioning impairment in comparison to typically developing peers in the normative population. Children with comorbid epilepsy, larger stroke volume, and/or older age were at increased risk for deficits in these cognitive domains.Ph.D., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "An Examination of the Correlation between Never Married, Heterosexual Black Males’ Self-Reported Experiences of Racism and their Desire to Marry",
    "description": "The topics of love and intimate relationships maintain a constant presence in popular and empirical discourse. Romantic relationships in the Black community have been of particular interest in the last decade and several researchers have developed connections between the low rate of Black marriages to the historical enslavement of African people in the United States (Bryant, Taylor, Lincoln, Chatters, & Jackson, 2008; Cherlin, 1998; Cole & Omari, 2003; Dickson, 1993; Jones, 2006; Landrine & Klonoff, 1996; Lawrence-Webb, Littlefield & Okundaye, 2004; Raley, 1996). Despite the apparent interest in \"Black love\", Black men are repeatedly excluded from research studies as viable subjects (Jenkins, 2006; Hurt, 2012; Roberts, 1994). Experiences of racism are prevalent for Black men, as with all Black people, and have extensive ramifications (Bonilla-Silva, 2006; Byrd & Clayton, 2000, 2002; Feagin & Spikes, 1994; Jones, 1997; LaVeist, 2002; Pinderhughes, 2002; Utsey & Ponterotto, 1996; West, 2001). One area, which is significantly impacted by racism, is family formation and, more specifically, the formation and maintenance of healthy partner relationships. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine whether experiences of racism impact desire to get married for never married, heterosexual Black men between age 18 and 45. A survey tool was used to administer two measurements: the Desire to Marry Scale (South, 1993), which measured marriage desirability, and the Schedule of Racist Events (Landrine & Klonoff, 1996), which measured perceived experiences of racism. Additionally, demographic information such as age, income, education, etc. was gathered.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "The Continuum of Premenstrual Symptom Exacerbation in Women With and Without Psychiatric Comorbidities: A Nurses' Health Study",
    "description": "Background: It is widely known that menstrual cycle fluctuations can significantly affect a woman's mood, behavior and quality of life over the course of her reproductive years, largely due to reproductive hormonal variations during the course of the menstrual cycle. In fact, women are twice as likely as men to experience a mood disorder. Approximately 85% percent of women experience some form of premenstrual symptom exacerbation (PME) and the majority experience symptoms, which are severe enough to interfere with their daily activities. Little is known, however, about the differences in symptom severity, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception among women who experience PME with and without psychiatric comorbidities. In addition, little is known about how psychiatric comorbidities affect severity of PME, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception. Methods: This study was conducted using a comparative descriptive design to compare premenstrual symptoms, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception among women experiencing PME and psychiatric comorbidities to women who experience PME without psychiatric comorbidities. Women with PME were recruited from various nursing organizations using secure online surveys. After collection of socio-demographic information, premenstrual symptom severity was measured with the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST), stress with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), quality of life with the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) and healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception were assessed using the Healthy Lifestyle Questionnaire (HLQ) & Wellness Self-Perception Scale (WSPS). Data Analysis: The data was cleaned, coded and assessed for outliers and shape of distribution prior to data analysis. Analysis included descriptive statistics to describe key characteristics of the sample, and inferential statistics to test the hypotheses. Results: After controlling for diet, exercise, sleep and caffeine intake, psychiatric comorbidities predicted greater PME symptom severity (β=0.22; T=2.45; P=0.02), higher perceived stress (β=0.25; T=2.61; P=0.01), and lower levels of wellness self-perception (β= -0.30; T= -3.14; P=0.00). Psychiatric comorbidities did not predict quality of life  (β= -0.13; T= -1.28; P=0.20) or healthy lifestyle (β= -0.13; T= -1.43; P=0.16). Significance: These findings may inform novel pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions and treatment guidelines to achieve optimal symptom management, reduce stress and improve wellness self-perception among women with PME and psychiatric comorbidities.Dr.N.P., Nursing Practice -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "The Lived Experience of Hallucinations in Adults with a Diagnosis of Schizophrenia: A Phenomenological Study",
    "description": "The purpose of this phenomenological research study was to explore the lived experience of hallucinations in adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The literature review introduces hallucinations as a symptom of schizophrenia and their related treatment. It presents first-hand accounts of schizophrenia and hallucinations and identifies phenomenological research of schizophrenia and hallucinations. It introduces art therapy use in the case of schizophrenia, and art therapy research of schizophrenia with evidence that there is a lack of qualitative studies of hallucinations in schizophrenia that utilize art as a means of data collection. \n\nTwo participants were recruited for this study from an outpatient mental health facility in Philadelphia, PA. One participant was male and one female. Both identified as African American, were between the ages of 18-55, and had experienced hallucinations related to their diagnosis of schizophrenia. Data was collected through a brief demographic survey, three drawing directives, and an open-ended interview. Art directives included “Draw what the experience of hallucinating is like for you” on a blank page, “Consider this figure an outline of you, and draw the experience of hallucinating in relation to the figure,” on a horizontal or vertical sheet with figure template, and “Fill the circle with what you would like to” on a page with mandala template. The open-ended interview focused on thoughts and feelings related to the first experience of hallucinations, content, frequency and modality experienced in, disclosure to others, management and treatment, and what it was like to express the experience in drawing. \n\nData was analyzed using phenomenological research methods outlined by Moustakas (1994). The following aspects were prominent in an analysis of interviews and drawings: 1) Confusion, doesn’t make sense and want to figure it out 2) Desire to escape and to isolate away from others 3) Difficulty in communicating about the experience 4) Extra perceptions in addition to perceptions of a shared reality 5) Flexible and ambiguous content 6) Involvement of different senses and/or multiple senses 7) Loss of ability to fully orient to a shared reality 8) Loss of autonomy requiring assistance and care 9) Medication and coping strategies 10) Past experiences effect on quality of hallucinations 11) Rarely talked about because of fear of judgment from others 12) Problem and something wrong/illness/punishment 13) Unpredictability, sometimes leading to paranoia.\n\nThe synthesis of these aspects suggests that time and space can be altered by the intrusion of hallucinations. They affect most senses and exist as extra perceptions in addition to those that others may share. Hallucinations can be disorienting, confusing, distracting, and scary. The content of hallucinations can vary given past experiences. There can be a desire to figure out the content of the experience. There is also a tendency to want to escape from the experience and also isolate and go away from others. \n\nIt is hard for individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia to communicate about their hallucinations given their complex and bizarre nature. Uncertainty about the experience and fear of stigma contribute to the limitation of expression.\n\nSupport from others is crucial for the health of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia who are experiencing hallucinations. It is relieving for individuals to speak about the experience with someone who they can trust. Mental health professionals, peers, family, friends, can help individuals cope with the experience and stay oriented to a shared reality, treat with medication, be empathetic to loss of autonomy, and explore thoughts of wanting to escape including thoughts of dying.M.A., Art Therapy and Counseling -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Objectification Theory and the Family: The Effect of Attachment Insecurity on Self-Objectification and Attentional Bias toward Eating Disorder Stimuli",
    "description": "Eating disorders (EDs) and disordered eating represent a serious public health issue among young adolescent and adult populations. EDs are predominately a problem for girls and women. Approximately 90% of people who develop EDs are female (Harvard Health Publications, 2012). Objectification theory (Frederickson & Roberts, 1997) posits that internalization of sexualized media messages (self-objectification) and social pressures lead to ED behaviors. Not all females exposed to objectifying stimuli experience ED behaviors. This study explored insecurity in family relationships as a risk factor; specifically, whether women who have greater attachment insecurity are more prone to self-objectification and ED-specific attentional bias. Components of Frederickson et al.'s (1998) and Tiggemann & Boundy’s (2008) experimental designs were replicated. This design has shown that (1) self-objectification can be heightened by context, and (2) self-objectification induces feelings of body shame, which promote ED behaviors. To test attachment insecurity as a risk factor in the objectification framework, a repeated measures experimental design was conducted with women (n = 107), between the ages of 18 and 35. This study utilized a repeated measures, experimental design where each participant either viewed an image set reinforcing the thin-ideal or a control image set of products (no people). Participants were assigned to one of four groups using the minimization method (high attachment insecurity and control images; low attachment insecurity and control images; high attachment insecurity and experimental images; low attachment insecurity and experimental images). Groups were balanced on race, type of insecurity (anxious, avoidant, both), and level of insecurity (over a standard deviation above the mean). The study involved deception in that participants were told that the purpose was to understand women’s attitudes towards advertising. Participants took a screening measure online to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria and then were invited to an in-person session. During in-person data-collection sessions, participants filled out outcome-specific, exploratory and deception self-report measures, viewed the experimental or control image set, and took a cognitive processing test with ED-specific stimuli. Using a factorial MANCOVA, the following hypotheses were tested while controlling for self-esteem (SISE) and parental psychological control (PCS-YSR): 1) Exposure to objectifying stimuli will cause higher levels of state self-objectification (TST) and greater attentional bias towards ED-salient stimuli (ED-specific stroop test); and 2) Exposure to objectifying stimuli will cause higher levels of state self-objectification and greater attentional bias towards ED-salient stimuli for the high attachment insecurity (ECR-RS) group. These hypotheses were tested within a sample of racially and ethnically diverse women. Results demonstrated that those in the high attachment insecurity group demonstrated more attentional bias towards ED-specific stimuli regardless of condition. Implications for family therapists and research limitations are discussed.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Role of art in the global climate change movement",
    "description": "The findings presented in this publication suggest that artists and arts administrators have significant roles to play when using the arts to address climate change. Responses from three artists and four scientists during in-depth one-on-one qualitative interviews indicate that the role of art in the global climate change movement is to deepen personal engagement with climate change issues by providing new platforms for deeper reflection and discourse—with or without the intent to catalyze activism. Artists do not need to maintain strict fidelity to climate change data, although there may be an inverse correlation between manipulating climate data and validation of the work to accurately comment on climate change. The contemporary climate change movement requires the integration of artists to respond to the challenges of climate change not merely as buffers between the public and the hard data but to incite a richer and more complex conversation through the cumulative impact of all art that addresses climate change.M.S., Arts Administration -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Resilient arts organizations: The growth of performing arts organizations through the 2008 economic recession",
    "description": "This thesis explores the impact that the 2008 U.S. economic recession has had on performing arts organizations. Through my research process, I compiled case studies of three mid-sized performing arts organizations based in the Mid-Atlantic for the greater purpose of examining traits successful arts organizations possessed during this economic downturn. My initial literature reviewed showed that organizations that were quick to adapt new and emerging trends and remained flexible in terms of changing market demands were the organizations which emerged the most successful through this time. However, the information I discovered through the case studies found that rather than emerging trends being utilized by successful organizations, calculated decisions such as merging organizations, hiring dedicated development staff, and transitioning board from working to governance, had instead led to the organizations’ overall sustainability and growth. This paper does not serve as a guide on how to build a successful performing arts organization, as this topic can never be answered in its entirety. It instead describes some of the best practices that have been adopted by specific organizations that have allowed for their success.M.S., Arts Administration -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Attachment, Problem Solving, and Their Role in Relationship Conflicts for Female Perpetrators",
    "description": "Intimate partner violence(IPV) has been associated with both physical and psychological trauma in both men and women. Women appear particularly vulnerable to these negative effects, whether they are the victims of IPV or the assailants. However, existing interventions to reduce IPV have been tested primarily in men, and appear to be less effective for women perpetrators. Two potential intervention targets for IPV that may be particularly salient for women are problem solving strategies and relationship attachment. Ineffective social problem solving and insecure attachment have been found to be significantly correlated with each other, and have each been associated with an increased likelihood of IPV. The present study examines the relationships among social problem solving, attachment style, and IPV perpetration in a sample of female undergraduate students. It is hypothesized that social problem solving will mediate the relationship between a person's attachment style and severity of IPV in a romantic relationship. 126 female Drexel undergraduate student volunteers age 18-25 were administered three questionnaires measuring social problem solving (the Social Problem Solving Inventory- Revised), IPV (the Conflict Tactics Scale 2), and attachment (the Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised). The questionnaires were completed on Drexel's SONA system. A bootstrap confidence interval from SPSS's PROCESS regression analysis, showed that social problem solving partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and IPV but not attachment avoidance.M.S., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Financial capacity and neuropsychological performance in acquired brain injury (ABI)",
    "description": "Difficulty with financial capacity (i.e., difficulty with efficiently managing one's finances), a common consequence in individuals with moderate to severe brain injury, has been found to affect self-autonomy and limit the individual from fully integrating into the community. Previous studies have found that individuals with brain injury have impaired financial capacity six months post-injury. However, the nature of financial capacity with post-injury periods extending to more than a year has not been studied. Moreover, there is mixed evidence regarding the nature and extent to which different cognitive abilities contribute to financial capacity. Therefore, the current study had three specific aims: (1) To compare the nature of financial capacity in individuals with chronic, moderate to severe acquired brain injury (ABI) with demographically matched controls. (2) To examine the contributions of various cognitive abilities (attention, working memory, executive functions, impulsivity) to financial capacity in the ABI group. (3) To investigate the association between the self-report and informant-report report of financial capacity, in the ABI group. A total of 25 participants with chronic, moderate to severe ABI were recruited from a day-treatment program, and 9 age and education matched-healthy control participants were recruited from the community. All participants were administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to measure cognitive abilities and the Financial Competence Assessment Inventory (FCAI) to assess financial capacity. In addition, 22 informants were interviewed using the Third Party Perspective FCAI. Results indicated that the control group outperformed the ABI group on the overall and the different dimensions of financial capacity. In the ABI group, specific cognitive abilities, including attention, working memory, delayed verbal memory, abstract reasoning and impulsivity contributed to different dimensions of financial capacity. However, no associations were found between ABI- and informant-reports of financial capacity suggesting the confounding presence of a combination of cognitive impairments and biases. These findings shed light on the compromised nature of financial management in ABI individuals years after a brain injury, and underscore the importance of focusing on continued monitoring and rehabilitation of this crucial functional ability.Ph.D., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Experiences of immigrant couple and family therapists clinically active in the United States: A Phenomenological Study",
    "description": "Immigration continues to be an important source of demographic growth in the United States (US Census Bureau, 2012). Mental health disciplines in general, and couple and family therapy in particular are paying more attention to immigration as an experience that can profoundly affect the identity and relationships of individuals and families. However, the impact of immigration has been addressed predominantly for immigrant clients. In the extant literature, much less attention has been paid to immigrants as couple and family therapists regarding how their experiences of immigration can affect clinical encounters with clients in the US. In order to fill this gap, this phenomenological dissertation study was designed to examine the clinical experiences of couple and family therapists who were born and raised outside of the US and who are clinically active in this country. Symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969; Mead, 1934) and the multicultural perspective as defined by Hardy and Laszloffy (2002) guided the development of this qualitative study which followed the stages and tasks of transcendental phenomenology (Moustakas, 1994). Thirteen immigrant couple and family therapists who were clinically active in the US volunteered for in-depth interviews. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the transcriptions were analyzed with the assistance of MaxQDA and using conventional content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005) to identify frequent and notable themes. The following major themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) the experience of immigration, (b) immigrant therapists and their clients, (c) development as a clinician, (d) relationships with colleagues and other professionals, and (e) a name for ourselves. The five major themes suggest that the exposure to different cultures during therapeutic encounters in the US and working in the midst of cultural differences affected participants’ clinical work. First, findings supported previous literature that described immigrant therapists as capable of having an outsider perspective, being more aware of their assumptions, being more flexible in their definitions, and experiencing discrimination by clients and other professionals in the US. Second, findings suggest that the therapeutic encounter is a relationship where meanings between therapists and clients are exchanged which facilitates identity transformations, the debunking of stereotypes, and the negotiation of new meanings. Regarding implications, findings from this study suggest that feedback from clients, supervisors, colleagues and faculty members affect the formation of immigrant CFTs’ evolving professional identities. Supervisors and faculty members in training programs should develop a more balanced view of immigrant CFT students and professionals that more closely attends to their needs and nurtures their strengths. CFT training programs and clinical supervisors should teach diversity and multiculturalism in a way that recognizes human diversity without promoting rigid categorization and divisiveness. Future research should pay closer attention to the strategies that immigrant CFTs develop that helps them clinically work in the midst of cultural differences with clients in the US.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Family Therapy Supervisors’ Sexual Attraction Towards Supervisees",
    "description": "Using sexual scripts theory, this web-based quantitative cross-sectional survey research study was designed to examine the associations among supervisors’ sexual scripts, comfort, training, and supervisors’ management of sexual attraction towards supervisees in a sample of 174 marriage and family therapy supervisors. Approximately half of the participants were females (54%) and most participants identified themselves as heterosexual (88.5%), White (78.7%) and Christian (55.7%). The participants’ ages were distributed as follows: 19% were less than 39 years old; 21.8% were between 40 and 49 years old; 23% were between 50 and 59; 25.9% were between 60 and 69 years old, 6.3% were older than 70 years old; 7 participants did not identify their age in the survey. Approximately 60% identified their theoretical style of supervision as “integrative”, approximately 20% reported their style as post-modern, and approximately 5% each identified their styles as Bowenian, Structural, Strategic, or Contextual. The experience of the participants (in years) as clinical supervisors was as follows: 35.6% had less than 10 years experience; 41.4% had between 11 and 21 years experience; 15.5% had 22 to 30 years experience; 6.3% had more than 31 years of clinical experience; and 2 participants did not complete this part of the survey. Finally, the self-reported sexual scripts of participants were as follows: 59.2% reported being liberal; 24.7% reported being traditional; 10.9% reported being conservative or religious; and 9 participants did not complete this part of the survey. Participants completed one survey for this study. The survey included questions about supervisors’ demographic information, sexual scripts (values), and experiences with sexual attraction in supervision. Survey questions were designed to explore supervisors’ levels of comfort with sexual attraction, the role of “self of the therapist” training in increasing supervisors’ awareness of their own sexual scripts, and abilities to make sound clinical decisions. The survey also examined how supervisors’ awareness of socio-cultural messages (cultural sexual scripts) influence their comfort (i.e., less emotional reactivity) with being sexually attracted to supervisees; and the resources (e.g., training, codes of ethics, or supervision) that have helped supervisors manage sexual attraction to supervisees. The results of the study demonstrated poor reliability of measure and very weak associations among supervisors’ sexual scripts, comfort, training and management of sexual attraction towards supervisees. The psychometrics of this study was not sound. Furthermore, in order to determine whether supervisors’ sexual scripts, comfort, or training were directly associated with their management of sexual attraction towards supervisees, the variables which had the highest correlations with five management parameters were analyzed in linear regression models. Nevertheless, the results produced very low r-squared values (ranging from .07 to .057), indicating little, if any, explanation of the variance in the management parameters. As a result, linear regression models could not be used to predict how supervisors manage their sexual attraction towards supervisees. In future studies, other variables may be explored in lieu of or in combination with the variables addressed in this study to improve the predictability of management through regression models with a reliable valid survey and a representative sample (probability) of AAMFT approved supervisors.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "An Arts-Based Study of the Dynamics of Expressing Positive Emotions within the Intersubjective Art Making Process",
    "description": "This arts-based research study explored the dynamics of expressing positive emotions, within the intersubjective art making process. The study addressed a multifaceted problem involving a gap in knowledge about the process of emotional expression through art making, which is key to therapeutic action in art therapy. The design was arts-based research, as art making was the primary means of inquiry. The philosophy and methodology of arts-based research were employed to explore the emotional aspects of intersubjective experience. Following the traditions of arts based research, the meaning-making capacity of creating art was used to illuminate the process of artistic creation in response to the research questions. The research was conducted following approval by the Drexel University IRB. Five English-speaking adults who were professional art therapists were recruited as key informants. The method of data generation involved an initial two hour Art Interview, followed by reflexive memoing and responsive art-making by the researcher and a subsequent second Art Interview with co-researchers. Methodological credibility procedures consisted of member checking and peer review. The data analysis processes involved: 1) traditional use of qualitative data analysis practices, such as the use of MAXQDA-10 software for coding for themes and 2) arts-based research data analysis methods. The analysis of the interview data, artistic data, artistic responses and a creative synthesis addressed the research question in the form of visual art pieces, poetry, a video, three stories, four themes, and a theoretical model. Overall, the verbal and artistic analysis of the data resulted in thematic categories that represent the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective art therapy relationship. Based upon the findings, the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective context was conceptualized as an iterative process beginning with metaphors of life and nature, the development of trust, revelations of emotion, empathic responses, reflexivity and joint artmaking creating and causing destabilization, deconstruction, reconstruction, and reimagining of perceptions and meanings. An emerging, holistic view of emotions and the transformative capacity of artmaking in a context of relational trust were discussed. Clinical applications included consideration of the therapeutic use of response art and joint artmaking. The limitations of the study were also described, as was methodological criteria for arts-based research. Overall, this expanding discourse helped to identify ways art therapy works. The study achieved its aim by contributing knowledge to our understanding of how emotions emerge, are expressed, and assigned meaning within an art therapy relational context.Ph.D., Creative Arts Therapies -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Determining the Efficacy of a Nutrition Education Intervention on Improving Consumer Comprehension of the Nutrition Label",
    "description": "Nutrition-related health problems and diseases have become a major concern in recent years. Scientists have established associations between Nutrition Label use and positive dietary outcomes. Furthermore, they have determined that consumers may be unable to correctly comprehend the information provided on Nutrition Labels. Research has shown that, although many variables play a role in limited label use among consumers, nutrition knowledge and a lack of nutrition education appear to be major concerns. Therefore, conducting nutrition education programs may ameliorate health illiteracy rates among the American population, increase label use, and ultimately improve dietary outcomes. This research will conduct a gender-focused nutrition education intervention in reading Nutrition Labels to college students in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of a nutrition education intervention in increasing comprehension of the Nutrition Label in college students. Participants will perform nutrition knowledge tests before and after the intervention. Baseline and post-intervention questionnaire scores will be compared by statistical analyses to determine the significance of the intervention.M.S., Human Nutrition -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Latino Skin Color: The Role of Discrimination, Racial identity, and Parental racial Socialization on Self Esteem and Depression",
    "description": "Using the Cross Racial Identity Model (Cross, 1991), Multidimensional Model of Racial Identity (Sellers, et al. 1998), and Helm's White Racial Identity Model (Helms, 1995), this web-based quantitative cross-sectional survey study was designed to examine the associations between selfreported skin color, racial discrimination, racial identity, parental racial socialization, selfesteem, and depressive symptoms in a convenience sample of 205 United States of America (USA) born Latinos (ages 18-25). Most participants were between 18 and 21 years old (64%) and were women (78.5%). Participants were asked to self-identify their race and approximately one-third [27% (n=56)] reported their race as White, and only 10.2% (n=21) reported their race as Black. Most self-reported their skin color as a lighter shade (89% rated their skin color between 1 and 4) and 31.2% (n=64) reported their skin color as \"2=very light\". Only 10.8% (n=22) reported their skin color as 5 and above (darker skin color). Approximately one-quarter reported their parent's country of origin is Mexico 24.9% (n=51) and others reported their parent's country of origin is the United States of America (15.1% n=31), or various countries in Latin America (e.g., Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Honduras, Cuba) and European Countries (e.g., Scotland, Spain, Ireland, Hungary). More than half were single when they completed the survey (58.5%), 39% were in a relationship, and 2.9% were married. Approximately, 70% reported they spoke another language while growing up; 64.9% reported speaking Spanish. Most were in college when they completed the survey (68.8% n=141). More than half reported their annual income as less than $10,000 (n=138; 67.3%) and approximately half reported their family's social economic status as working class (43.9%). Participants first completed a demographic questionnaire and then 5 valid and reliable self-report surveys to examine their skin color, racial identity, perceived racial discrimination, parental racial socialization, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Results suggest that racial identity, specifically the self-hatred and anti-dominant stages of the cross identity stages of development, and not skin color or parental racial socialization is a significant mediator between perceived racial discrimination and self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Participants who perceived more racial discrimination and who were in the self-hatred stage tended to report more depressive symptoms (partial mediation). Results of the second mediation analysis suggest that the self-hatred and anti-dominant scales are significantly associated with lower self-esteem and is a fully mediated model because the racial discrimination path was not significant. Thus, for USA born Latinos who report experiencing racial discrimination, the more grounded in self-hatred or anti-dominant identities, the lower their self-esteem and the more depressive symptoms they tend to experience. This is a noteworthy finding which supports Cross's (1991) racial identity development. Results also suggest that parental socialization towards equality despite racial differences is a significant predictor of higher self-esteem and less depressive symptoms. This dissertation study has important implications for family therapists who are working with young adult USA born Latinos. First, more comprehensive clinical assessments should be done to better understand Latinos' experiences of racial discrimination, racial identity, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Clinicians should focus on the importance of parental socialization toward equality, in particular when Latino youth report experiencing discrimination, depressive symptoms, and lower self-esteem. In future research studies, two or more racial identity models should be used to capture the diverse ways Latinos tend to racially identify in the USA. Studies should also be designed to prospectively evaluate the importance of racial identity development over time from childhood to young adulthood to better understand Latino mental health and well-being in order to develop culturally sensitive family prevention programs for parents and youth.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Effectiveness of Interval vs. Endurance Training to Minimize Asthmatic Symptoms in Recreationally Active Adults",
    "description": "The prevalence of asthma is on the rise, affecting the quality of life of those who suffer from this condition. There are several treatments for asthma, exercise being one of the most affordable, while also offering other physiologic benefits. High intensity interval training (HIIT) consists of short bouts of maximal intensity exercise, followed by short periods of recovery. Endurance training consists of continuous, steady-state aerobic exercise, usually around 70% to 80% of maximal heart rate for 30 to 60 minutes in duration. Improvements in asthmatic symptoms have been seen utilizing both training protocols; however, most of the participants in these studies have been children. The purpose of this study was to determine if exercise will improve asthmatic symptoms of recreationally active adults, and to determine if there is a difference in interval and endurance training protocols in terms of asthmatic symptoms. It was hypothesized that exercise will improve asthmatic symptoms; however, due to lack of recruitment, the second aim of this study was not addressed. One recreationally active adult, 26 years of age, with no other chronic diseases, was recruited through the use of flyers. The participant was informed of the risks and benefits before partaking in any training protocol. Due to the fact that only one participant was recruited and time constraints to conduct a crossover design study (as was originally intended), the participant was randomly assigned to a six-week endurance protocol. Biometric and pulmonary measurements were taken before and after the protocol. It may appear that there was a slight decrease in pulmonary functions following the six-week endurance protocol; however, the measurements are likely within normal variation. Because this was a case study, no statistical analyses could be performed to determine statistical significance.M.S., Human Nutrition -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "The Effects of Self-Book© Art Therapy on Emotional Distress in Female Cancer Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
    "description": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the Self-Book© art therapy intervention on emotional distress and psychological well-being in female cancer patients. Assessing and treating patients’ unmet emotional needs is a national focus in oncology care today. The intervention provided patients with an opportunity to portray their feelings and identify coping skills artistically through a creative process. Art therapy is based on the theory that the human mind tends to experience intrusive and avoidant stress response symptoms when faced with adverse events, such as a life-threatening illness. Creative expression can help patients reintegrate their sense of self and strengthen personal attributes. To evaluate the intervention, a repeated measures randomized controlled trial design was employed. Sixty consenting women were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the six-session Self-Book© art therapy intervention group or the standard care control group. Results suggest that Self-Book© art therapy may help decrease emotional distress and enhance spiritual well-being in female cancer patients during active oncology treatment. Positive trends in the data were present, but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups for the two main variables. Small treatment effects were found for Self-Book© art therapy on participants’ psychological well-being. However, one subscale measure revealed statistically significant greater improvements in Self-Book© art therapy participants’ spiritual wellbeing compared to the standard care control participants. Additionally, 30% of art therapy participants reported post-intervention emotional distress scores that were below the clinical range for emotional distress, compared with only 5% of standard care control participants, suggesting that Self-Book© art therapy has clinical significance. Analysis of limited narrative data from exit interviews contributed to positive trends in emotional distress, suggesting that emotional needs were met for the majority of Self-Book© art therapy participants.Ph.D., Creative Arts Therapies -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "Experiences of Couples Having a Young Child with Cleft Lip and/or Palate, Comparing Prenatal and Postnatal Diagnosis Groups: A Phenomenological Study",
    "description": "This study was designed to describe the experiences of both mothers and fathers who are currently caring for an infant (12 months old) or young child (up to 4 years old) who was born with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P). The biopsychosocial approach, the Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation, and transcendental phenomenology guided this study. A convenience sample consisted of 17 couples (10 prenatal and 7 postnatal) who previously volunteered for an ongoing longitudinal quantitative study at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia [PI: Dr. Canice E. Crerand, PhD (2008). Psychosocial adjustment in parents of infants with cleft lip and/or palate: The impact of prenatal versus postnatal diagnosis]. Couples completed a consent form, a demographic self-report survey, and the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale and then participated in in-depth interviews. The timing of the CLP diagnosis, the birth, and the initial stages after birth were reported as the most challenging periods for both prenatal and postnatal couples, unless their children still had ongoing developmental delays. The initial stages immediately following the birth were reported as more stressful for the postnatal diagnosis group because they had no time to prepare. Course of treatment, feeding, and social stigma were reported as major sources of stress for all 17 couples. Findings suggest that, regardless of the timing of the diagnosis, couples could benefit from (1) health professional's calm demeanor when first delivering the CL/P diagnosis, because it affects how parents perceive the CL/P, which later determines how they cope and problem solve; (2) an initial information session with both parents at the time of the diagnosis; (3) peer support from other couples to reduce their feelings of isolation; (4) help from health professionals to alleviate any self-blame, especially for the mothers; and (5) help for couples who are more distressed at diagnosis and especially during the first year after birth, such as regular screening and referrals for couple-based interventions to promote secure attachment and better coping. Finally, future research should include more racially and economically diverse samples of couples to develop culturally sensitive intervention programs.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "The Effect of Palliative Care Team-led Family Meetings on End-of-Life Decision-Making Among Medical Surrogates of Hospitalized, Incapacitated, Senior, African Americans with Life Limiting Illnesses",
    "description": "Culture and ethnicity are known to influence end-of-life decision-making. The purpose of this study was to conduct a retrospective chart review to explore whether Palliative Care Team (PCT)-led family meetings influence end-of-life decisions made by medical surrogates of hospitalized, incapacitated, senior, African Americans suffering with life limiting illnesses. Using Imogene King’s nursing theory of Goal Attainment as the overarching framework in achieving effective caring, the electronic medical records (EMRs) of 96 African Americans, whose medical surrogates participated in a PCT-led family meeting on their behalf to discuss end-of-life care options from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 were reviewed. Data extracted from EMRs identified end-of-life decisions made by the surrogates. The data were also examined to compare decisions made by surrogates with what the patients documented in their Living Wills (LW). Finally, the data were used to examine relationships between age, gender, and kinship, and end-of-life decisions made by surrogates on the patient’s behalf. Demographics and variables were examined using descriptive statistics. ANOVA and Pearson Chi-Square were utilized to evaluate relational significance. A significant relationship was noted between decreased length of hospital stay and those transitioned to comfort care. Additionally, a representative number (40%) of these patients were transitioned from restorative to comfort care following their surrogate’s participation in a PCT-led meeting. While few (13.5%) had a LW, of those LWs available, the medical surrogates generally upheld the patients’ wishes documented within their LW. Age, gender, and kinship played an insignificant role in the surrogate’s care pathway decision. Meetings were conducted by PCT physicians or nurse practitioners. Both obtained similar meeting outcomes, thus implying that family meeting facilitation skills are similar between these disciplines. This work suggests that the PCT-led family meeting can influence medical surrogate decision-making. Future efforts must focus on fostering the right of autonomy among African Americans, and providing education concerning the importance of the LW. Making PCTs available to those involved in end-of-life decision-making can further efforts to eliminate health care disparities which African Americans continue to face.Dr.N.P., Nursing Practice -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "A Study on the Dispute of Islands in the Northeastern Asia:With Emphasis on the Territorial Dispute about Tokdo",
    "description": "United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea had been concluded in 1982 through a long session, and by many times of argument, and entered into force in November, 1994. United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea that 157 States put an agreement under their signature, 138 nations ratified up to now February, 2002 was arranged as The Magna Carta of the sea. \n\n\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has an object to settle dispute between subjects of International law, or to settle dispute that has already occurred between subjects of International law in an amicable way. In the northeastern Asia, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea did not achieved it's object, but produced \"a quite contrary result\". Because United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea regulates the exclusive right of the coastal State positively, and the coastal States are anxious to expand the bounds of the sea that they can govern like land. \n\n\nThis phenomenon is detected obviously at the dispute of islands. In the northeastern Asia, Korea, Japan, China(Taiwan), and Russia are pitted against each other for its interest on the other side of the sea. They recognize the importance of the sea, so it leaves some room to dispute. \n\n\nIn the northeastern Asia, there are 3 disputes of islands. Russia and Japan are pitted against each other about the islands of the southern Kuril Islands, and the confrontation of small island adjacent Taiwan is going on. \n\n\nFirstly, dispute about \"Northern Territories(Japan designated)\" between Russia and Japan. Secondly, dispute about \"Senkaku Islands(Japan designated)\" between China, or Taiwan, and Japan. \n\n\nThe third, the last, one is the dispute about \"Tokdo\" that the antagonism is going on. \n\n\nWhen I study about dispute about \"Tokdo\", first of all, I arrange two aspects of dispute about \"Tokdo\". \n\n\nThe Northen Territories is occupied by Russia, but there is stronger will of Japan about the Northern Territories than will of Japan about other disputing region, so there is substantial negotiation using economic support as intermediation at the northern territory. In 1991, since The Soviet Union broke down, both Russia and Japan cleared hostile relation, and built companion relation under the end of the Cold War, furthermore they made diplomatic effort to settle dispute about territory. \n\n\nSpecially, with collapse of The Soviet Union, New force of Reformation in Russia that got faced with total crisis established a principle that they return four islands of Kuril Islands by stages on condition of economic support in a big way. Also, Japan that concluded that they could recover the northern territory, because the Yeltsin adminstration needed economic support of Japan after the end of the Cold War, so Japan concentrated on negotiation about the northern territory on condition of economic support. As a result, both Russia and Japan reached conclusion with adopting the joint declaration \n\n\nThere are some importances that China can't concede Senkaku Islands. Firstly, in the southern sea of China, any concession can't be expected, because the southern sea of China is related other dispute of island, secondly, existence of petroleum is clarified at the coast, therefore China is expected that it shows the effectiveness of armaments to consolidate the effectiveness against this waters, or that it tries substantial exploration to make foundation of possession. \n\n\nAgainst this, Japan is evading positively the phenomena that lead the result that can magnify or deepen character of dispute to maintain substantial control. Senkaku Islands are certainly belongs to Japan, therefore what is useless to debate about Senkaku Islands are Japan's standpoint. \n\n\nJapan's will looks passive against \"Tokdo\" as compared to Japan's will about the northern territory and standpoint of Senkaku Islands, but it is very positive as compared to position of Korea. As compared to the government of Korea that insists \"no dispute\" about \"Takesima(Japan designated)\"-like Japan that insists \"no dispute\" about dispute about Senkaku Islands-, the government of Japan stresses that there is a dispute by formal announcement of the government of Japan with presenting wrongfulness about the occupation of \"Tokdo\" of Korea. \n\n\nJapan is the nation that adopts expansive policy of the sea, with establishing exclusive economic zone, continental shelf, or straight baseline for its interest from the island that doesn't satisfy essential condition for island. With considering these factors, against dispute about island, Japan is expected that it doesn't concentrate on triumph on one place, but it aims at overall triumph. \n\n\nThere is no guarantee not to apply the method of Japan that lead advantageous situation of Japan by progress of negotiation through economic intermediation, or by manipulation of public opinion of circumference for \"Tokdo\", therefore Korea has to prepare certain foundation about assertion of dominium of \"Tokdo\", with dismissing disregarding, and avoiding position about phenomenon.목차\n\n\n제1장 서론 = 1\n\n\n 제1절 연구의 목적 = 1\n\n\n 제2절 연구의 범위와 방법 = 4\n\n\n제2장 해양경계획정, 섬제도 및 국가 영역에 관한 고찰 = 6\n\n\n 제1절 서언 = 6\n\n\n 제2절 해양경계획정 = 7\n\n\n  I. 1958년 해양법에 관한 협약상의 경계획정 = 7\n\n\n   1. 「영해 협약」 = 7\n\n\n   2. 「대륙붕？夏胥？ = 8\n\n\n   3. 제3차 UN해양법회의에서의 논의 = 8\n\n\n    (1) 경계획정 논의의 필요성 증대 = 8\n\n\n    (2) 논의의 방향 = 9\n\n\n    (3) ISNT(1975년) = 9\n\n\n    (4) RSNT(1976년) = 9\n\n\n    (5) ICNT(1977년) = 10\n\n\n    (6) 협상그룹-7에서의 협의 = 10\n\n\n    (7) NG-7 의장의 절충안 = 11\n\n\n  II. 「UN해양법협약」상의 해양경계획정 = 12\n\n\n   1. 영해의 경계획정 = 12\n\n\n   2. 배타적 경제수역의 경계획정 = 12\n\n\n   3. 대륙붕의 경계획정 = 13\n\n\n 제3절 섬제도 = 13\n\n\n  I. 섬의 정의 = 13\n\n\n   1. 섬의 정의에 대한 논의 = 13\n\n\n    (1) 국제법위원회의 초안 = 13\n\n\n    (2) 1958년 「영해협약」 = 14\n\n\n    (3) 1982년 「UN해양법협약」 = 14\n\n\n   2. 섬에 대한 법적 개념요소의 분석 = 14\n\n\n    (1) 바다로 둘러싸일 것 = 14\n\n\n    (2) 자연적으로 형성된 섬 = 14\n\n\n    (3) 육지지역 = 15\n\n\n    (4) 고조시 수면 위에 있을 것 = 15\n\n\n  II. 섬의 관할 수역 = 15\n\n\n  III. 인공섬 = 15\n\n\n  IV. 산호암초 = 16\n\n\n   1. 협약 규정 = 16\n\n\n   2. 규정의 모호성 = 17\n\n\n    (1) 외곽에 있는 암초 = 17\n\n\n    (2) 암초의 해양측 저조선 = 17\n\n\n    (3) 외곽암초의 본도로부터의 거리 제한 = 17\n\n\n  V. 경계획정의 기준으로서의 섬의 가치 = 18\n\n\n  VI. 제121조 제3항의 문제 = 19\n\n\n   1. 의미의 모호성 = 19\n\n\n    (1) 표현상의 모호성 = 19\n\n\n    (2) 의미의 확정 = 19\n\n\n   2. 제121조 제3항의 요건 = 20\n\n\n    (1) 거주 가능성 = 20\n\n\n    (2) 독자적 경제활동의 지속 = 20\n\n\n    (3) 요건의 모호성 = 20\n\n\n    (4) 협약 문언상의 해석 = 21\n\n\n   3. 무인도의 관할수역 인정에 관한 양론 = 21\n\n\n    (1) 긍정적 의견 = 21\n\n\n    (2) 부정적 의견 = 21\n\n\n   4. 각국의 관행 = 22\n\n\n   5.

    "title": "A Study of Sovereign Right over Dokdo Island",
    "description": "Dok-do is an island located 47.4 sea miles east of Ulleung-do and 85.2 miles west of Okisyoto of Japan, in 37°14'18\"N and in 131°52'33\"E\n\n\nDok-do has been owned as the territory of Shilla ever since A.D. 512 (the 13th year of the King Chi-jung of the Dynasty of Shilla) and has been ruled and administered virtually by Korea as a part of our territory through Goryeo(高麗) and Chosun (朝鮮) Dynasty without being disregarded or abandoned up the date\n\n\nSamguksagi(三國史記) that was edited in 1145 is the material which supports this fact and we can confirm it in other many books, in other words, we can find it definitely that Korea had already ensured the sovereign right about Dok-do in many historical respects facts as followings.\n\n\nFirst, Samguksagi says that Yi, Sa-bu(異斯夫) conquered Woosanguk(于山國) and subjected it to Shilla in AD 512. Mangiyoram(萬機要覽) which was edited in 1808 says about Woosanguk, \"Ulleung-do and Woosan-do are the territory of Woosanguk and it is Woosan-do that Japan is Song-do(松島)\". and also we can make sure that Woosan-do is present Dok-do in the books like Cheungbomunheonbigo(增補文獻備考), Se-jong Authentic record of geography(世宗實錄地理志), History of Goryeo(高麗史)\n\n\nThey say the \"the distance of Woosan-so and Ulleung-do are not far from, so they can be seen the other side when it is fine\"\n\n\nSecond, Tae-jong Authentic record(太宗實錄), Se-jong Authentic record(世宗實錄) goes as followings.\n\n\nKim, Lin-woo(金麟雨), got the position of Woosanmureung-choanmusa(于山武陵等處按撫使) form the Chosun Dynasty when they carried the Empty Island policy(空島政策) of making Ulleung-do uninhabited island. In the fact that mentioned above, We can confirm that Woosan-do was included into Ulleung-do, which had been ruled and managed together.\n\n\nBesides, while Empty Island policy they sent Suto-kwan(搜討官) every 3 years to control the is islands.\n\n\nAll these historical facts show that Woosan-do has never been disregarded.\n\n\nThird, on the old Korean map, the record involved in Woosan-do was written of the map or on the right of it as well as Woosan-do was marked next to Ulleung-do. It makes sure that Woosan-do is our territory \n\n\nFourth, on Oct. 25, 1900, in the document of subject territory, Article 41. it is written that the extent of jurisdiction of Ulleung-do, Juk-do, and Suk-do(=Dok-do) We can find out certainly this fact that Dok-do had been controled by Chosun Dynasty.\n\n\nBased on this historical facts, we can surely know that Dok-do has had a firm sovereign right historically as an Korean territory \n\n\nHowever, Japan insists that Dok-do is their own land, or Dok-do has been incorporated into Japan through Dokeun-hyun(島根縣) Notification No. 40 in 1905, 04 sometimes they take the incompleteness of the postwar documents after the 2nd World War.\n\n\nThe followings are the integrated opinions which criticize the fabrication of Japanese insistence like that.\n\n\nIst. Japan still insists that Dok-do is the land of Japan. But this is full of inconsistencies.\n\n\n① Japanese myth describes that the territory of Japan consists of Honshu(本州), Kyushy(九州), Shikoku(四國) and Dangrodou(淡路島), so Dok-do and even some other parts of the present territory of Japan are not of Japan \n\n\n② Japan called Dok-do the land which was belonged to nobody through Dokenu-hyun Notification and incorporated it into Japan. But this seems to acknowledge that Dok-do had not been the land of Japan.\n\n\n③ The lst Japanese book Unjushichonghapki(隱州視聽合記) manifests that Dok-do belongs to the ancient Goryeo(高麗).\n\n\n④ According to Japanese official documents which was written in 1869, Japanese Foreign Minister and Taejongkwan(太政官)said that Ulleung-do and Dok-do belonged to Goryeo. And in 1877 Taejongkwan ordered that Dok-do should be eliminated from Dokeun-hyun. And the officials of the ministry of Foreign Affairs didn't grand the right to develop Song-do in 1878 owing to the fact that Dok-do belongs to Ulleung-do.\n\n\n⑤ According to the Japanese maps, Samkukjopyand Map(三國接壤地圖) drawn by Hayashi in 1785, and Chonghoi Map(總繪圖) which was drawn in 18C, Japan painted Dok-do the same color with Chosun.\n\n\nMore to the point, the map of Chosun Eastern Sea which was drawn by Japan ministry of Navy and Chosun Map drawn in 1852 and a number of Japan's ancient maps show that Dok-do is the territory of Chosun.\n\n\n2nd, knowing that the theory Dok-do is the land of Japan is not in Japan's favor, Japan insists that Dok-do be the land of Japan through prior occupation theory using Dokeun-hyun Notification No.40. But the falsehood of Japan's prior occupation theory is as follows.\n\n\n① Although the object of prior occupation had to be the land owned by nobody, Dok-do had its owner. In other words, Empty Island Policy was carried out from the 17th year of Tae-jong by Chosun Dynasty. What is more, Chosun dispatched officials every 3 year and ruled Dok-do. And Dok-do incorporated Dok-do into the administrative district through Royal Decree in 1900, it was 5 years earlier than that of Japan. All these historical facts manifest that Dok-do has had its owner.\n\n\n② There are some points at issue in the process of her proclamation. The national decision on territory incorporation on must be published in the official Gazette, but it was reported in a newspaper of a local government, Dokeun-hyun, So according to the international law, this behavior can't be the expression of a nation and has no effect. Besides it's not reasonable that Japan called Dok-do the land of no owner and Japan incorporated it into the territory of Japan although shogunate of the Dokchogawa(德川幕府) and Maijie government(明治政府) acknowledged that Dok-do belonged to Chosun. As Japanese scholars acknowledge, it's very clear that her behaviors are expressions of imperialism. So according of the international law, her doctrine has no validity\n\n\n3rd, Japan insists that the postwar documents, SCAPIN NO. 677, has an article Ulleung-do, Dok-do, Cheju-do should be excepted from Japan, and this article is political and administrative. Using the article of The Peace Treaty with Japan that acknowledges the independence of Korea including Ulleung-do, Dok-do, Cheju-do, Japan insists that Dok-do be the land of Japan. But as we discussed before, Japan's opinion is not accord with the international law.\n\n\nConcluding this study,\n\n\n① The Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration have binding force because Japan surrendered unconditionally. So the article \"Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed\" must be translated like this, all the other territories are the territories that Japan has taken since China-Japan War in 1895. And \tDok-do was taken in 1905 and it gained its independence from the day Aug 15, 1945.\n\n\n② SCAPIN No. 677 which was written by the General Headquarter of the Allied Forces insisted that Dok-do be the land of Korea, and then it was sent to the Japan government. And the document has a legal power.\n\n\n③ These islands like Cheju-do, Keomun-do, and Ulleung-do which was mentioned in the Peace Treaty with Japan are only representatives of all the Korean islands. If Japan would restore Dok-do which was separated from Japan to the Peace Treaty with Japan, there should be an article that Dok-do belongs to Japan or a new article from the Allied Forces. It's clearly considered that Dok-do can never be separated from Korea without these active articles.\n\n\nAs mentioned above Japan has insisted on the theory of Japan, Japan's prior occupation theory and postwar documents of the Allied Forces as Japan's opinion that Dok-do is the land of Japan.\n\n\nTherefore we can manifest that the assertion of Japan is unreasonable.목차\n\n\n第1章 序論 = 1\n\n\n 第1節 硏究의 目的 = 1\n\n\n 第2節 硏究의 範圍 및 方法 = 2\n\n\n第2章 海洋法上의 島嶼의 法的地位와 獨島 = 4\n\n\n 第1節 海洋法上 島嶼의 地位 = 4\n\n\n  1. 島嶼의 定義 = 4\n\n\n  2. 島嶼의 法的地位 = 5\n\n\n 第2節 海洋法上의 獨島의 地位 = 5\n\n\n  1. 獨島의 槪觀 = 5\n\n\n  2. 獨島의 法的地位 = 6\n\n\n  3. 獨島의 重要性 = 7\n\n\n第3章 獨島 領有權問題의 歷史的分析 = 9\n\n\n 第1節 問題의 發端 = 9\n\n\n 第2節 獨島의 名稱 = 10\n\n\n  1. 韓國側의 名稱 = 10\n\n\n  2. 日本側의 名稱 = 12\n\n\n  3. 外國에서의 名稱 = 13\n\n\n 第3節 韓日兩國의 獨島 領有權關聯 記錄 및 諸措置 = 14\n\n\n  1. 朝鮮時代以前 兩國의 獨島關聯 記錄 및 諸措置 = 14\n\n\n  2. 朝鮮時代 兩國의 獨島關聯 記錄 및 措置 = 17\n\n\n  3. 日帝强占時期의 獨島·關聯記錄 및 措置 = 24\n\n\n  4. 光復以後의 獨島關聯 記錄 및 措置 = 32\n\n\n第4章 獨島 領有權問題의 法的分析 = 36\n\n\n 第1節 獨島의 島根縣編入에 관한 問題 = 36\n\n\n  1. 中井養三郞의 '獨島編入 및 貸下請願' = 36\n\n\n  2. 日本側의 國際法上 先？우둬？ 惡用 = 38\n\n\n  3. 先占理論에서의 通告義務 = 38\n\n\n  4. 島根縣告示의 國際法的 性格 = 40\n\n\n 第2節 日本의 韓半島 强占과 獨島 = 42\n\n\n  1. 카이로(Cairo)宣言과 日本의 領土處理 = 42\n\n\n  2. 포츠담(Potsdam)宣言과 獨島處理 = 43\n\n\n 第3節 韓國光復과 獨島問題 = 45\n\n\n  1. 聯合國 最高司令官總司令部의 日本占領下 領土處理 = 45\n\n\n  2. 對日講和條約과 獨島 = 52\n\n\n 第4節 獨島問題의 國際司法裁判所 管轄權 = 55\n\n\n  1. 槪觀 = 55\n\n\n  2. 獨島問題에 대한 對人的 管轄權 = 56\n\n\n  3. 獨島問題에 대한 對物的 管轄權 = 57\n\n\n  4. 結語 = 58\n\n\n第5章 島嶼 領有權紛爭 事例硏究와 適用 = 60\n\n\n 第1節 島嶼 領有權紛爭 事例 = 60\n\n\n  1. 팔마스(Palmas)島 事件 = 60\n\n\n  2. 東部 그린랜드(Greenland)島 事件 = 62\n\n\n  3. 망끼에·에크레오(Minquiers·Ecrehos)島 事件 = 64\n\n\n 第2節 事例의 適用意義와 爭點 = 66\n\n\n  1. 適用意義 = 66\n\n\n  2. 事例의 爭點 = 66\n\n\n 第3節 事例의 獨島問題에의 適用 = 67\n\n\n第6章 結論 = 70\n\n\n 第1節 獨島 領有權의 歸屬問題 = 70\n\n\n 第2節 獨島 領有權問題의 平和的 解決方案 = 72\n\n\n  1. 平和的 解決을 위한 接近方法 = 73\n\n\n  2. 平和的 解決을 위한 우리의 對應姿勢 = 76\n\n\n參考文獻 = 78\n\n\nABSTRACT = 8",

    "title": "(A) Study on the Liner Bill of Lading in English Law and Case",
    "description": "A Study on Liner Bill of Lading\n\n\nin English Law and Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  It is very interesting to note that neither the Bills of Lading Act 1855 nor any Act has defined the meaning of 'Bill of Lading'. But we can find that definition in Article 1 of the Hamburg Rules as follows:\n\n\n'Bill of Lading' means a document which evidences a contract of carriage by sea and the taking over or loading of the goods by the carrier, and by which the carrier undertakes to deliver the goods against surrender of the document, A provision in the document that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a named person, or to order, or to bearer, constitutes such an undertaking.\n\n\n  As a matter of fact, the document which developed to resolve the obvious conflicts between the interests of buyer and seller was the bill of lading. The bill of lading provides the seller with some security against default by the buyer, and provides the buyer with some assurance of performance of the seller before the buyer is required to make payment. So to speak, the B/L provides some extent protection for both seller and buyer.\n\n\n  In the view of the law, a bill of lading has various aspects: First, it is very good evidence of the contract of carriage of goods, though not the contract itself, for the contract is usually concluded before the bill of lading is signed. Second, it is a receipt for the goods shipped and contains certain admissions as to their quantity and condition when put on board. Third, it is a document of title. Therefore we cannot normally be obtained the goods without the delivery of the document.\n\n\n  However, there are various types of bill of lading. Specially, this is a study on the construction of Liner Bill of Lading(Code name : CONLINEBILL) adapted by BIMCO(The Baltic and International Maritime Conference) and used a basic bill of lading in the liner ship's operating. By that reasons, applying to English Law, Case and 6 rules of construction in the interpretation of clauses, I make a wider and deeper study of claims and obligations of Contract Parties under Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971(COGSA 1971).\n\n\n  For reference, The Hague-Visby Rules consist of the original Hague Rules amended by the Visby Amendments, but the rules are more properly referred to as \"The Protocol to amend the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading signed at Brussels on 25th August 1924 - Brussels 23rd February 1968\". COGSA 1971 applies the original Hague Rules incorporating the Visby Amendments as the Schedule.\n\n\n  In concrete terms about this study, Chapter 1 outlines the purpose of this study as well as the scope. Chapter 2 deals with the general study about the bill of lading. This chapter outlines definition, function, kind and nature of the bill of lading and considers the standard rules of the construction to the bill of lading for the clarification of CONLINEBILL.\n\n\n  Proceeding to the main issue, Chapter 3, 4, 5 and 6 deal with the construction of CONLINEBILL. These divided chapters make a term of significance for the each clause by means of the classification of CONLINEBILL's legal construction. Chapter 3 has 3 categories of legal construction. Section 1 in Chapter 3 includes the conclusion of contract such as General Paramount Clause and Jurisdiction Clause. Section 2 accounts for the real structure in CONLINEBILLSubstitution of Vessel, Transhipment and Forwarding Clause. The last section 3 explains the personal structure in Definition Clause. Then I try to grasp the meaning of each clause through the original text, the translated text into Korean and the explanation of the clauses gradually.\n\n\n  It deals with the rights and obligations of shipowner in Chapter 4 and those of Merchant in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 considers danger management of CONLINEBILL such as General Average and Salvage Clause and Both-to-Blame Collision Clause.\n\n\n  The last Chapter 7 conclude the characteristic of CONLINEBILL as well as summary of the previous chapters and deals with the comparative study between COGSA 1971 and CONLINEBILL.\n\n\n  As follows the characteristics of CONLINEBILL are concluded from the current study. First, this bill of lading exclude General immunity clause, Seaworthiness clause, The limitation of liability though including important these clauses in the Hague-Visby Rules. Second, this bill of lading specially provides Identity of Carrier clause clarified the subject of responsibility in carriage of goods by sea, Exemptions and Immunities of all servants and agents of the Carrier, Carrier's option by means of containers or similar articles of transport used to consolidate goods and unitization of receptacles such as container, trailer and transportable tank. Third, Lighterage clause, Loading, Discharging and Delivery clause and Freight and Charge clause are to rationalize through the settlement of the company's account. Fourth, as CONLINEBILL is adapted by BIMCO which has the international reputation and approved by shipping industries, the bill of lading aims to develop the shipping communities and tries to make a standard bill of lading based upon the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to Bills of Lading",

    "description": "It is important to retrieve information that a user requires on the web. The web is an open system. The amount of information is increasing rapidly. While each of information was compiled into the database piece at a single platform in the past, it is now compiled into complicated structure at a multi-platform. Restructuring the multi-platform database is needed to efficiently retrieve information. MIRAS (Meta Information Retrieval Agent System) has a multi-platform database on the web. This study applies the classification of the existing sites' categories to restructure the database systematically. The empirical analysis shows that the suggested method is effective for information retrieval and multi-platform database restructuring. This study helps users to save on time-cost of searching information.목차\n\n\nI 서론 = 1\n\n\n 1. 연구의 개요 = 1\n\n\n 2. 연구의 목적 및 범위 = 1\n\n\n 3. 논문의 구성 = 2\n\n\nII 이론적 배경 = 3\n\n\n 1. 에이전트 = 3\n\n\n  1.1 에이전트의 정의 = 3\n\n\n  1.2 고객-서버 모형에서의 에이전트의 필요성 = 3\n\n\n 2. 정보검색 = 4\n\n\n  2.1 단일플랫폼의 정보검색 = 4\n\n\n  2.2 다중플랫폼의 메타 검색 = 4\n\n\n  2.3 데이터베이스의 선택문제 = 5\n\n\n  2.4 문서 분류 및 카테고리 = 6\n\n\n 3.

    "title": "Examining gender role beliefs and marital satisfaction of Ghanaian immigrant couples in the U.S.A.",
    "description": "The experiences of African immigrants to the United States of America are sparsely represented in the literature. Recent research has focused more on Latinos and Asian ethnic minority populations than on African immigrants. Further, given the paucity of research on this population, it is no surprise the limited literature has ignored important factors such as family relationships and marital issues. Therefore, exploring the relationship between gender role beliefs and marital satisfaction among Ghanaian immigrant couples is necessary to help inform and contribute to the literature in Couple and Family Therapy research particularly for a subgroup living in the United States who has been virtually ignored. Acculturation theory was introduced as a framework to facilitate understanding of the relationship between gender role beliefs of Ghanaian immigrant couples and their level of marital satisfaction in the American culture. This study examined these variables with a correlation predictive design using a cross-sectional survey technique of 77 Ghanaian immigrant adult couples currently residing in the tri-state of area of New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. It was hypothesized that Ghanaian immigrant couples who have more congruent gender role beliefs would have higher levels of marital satisfaction. The results indicated to the contrary. Husbands were liberal in their gender role beliefs compared to wives; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Future studies could explore covariates such as ethnic background, level of education, and counseling services. These were good correlates of gender role beliefs and marital satisfaction in the study.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "A Study on Planning of International Cruise Ship Terminal at Busan port",
    "description": "The main thrust of architectural planning for international cruise ship terminal is intended to bring about environmental change which permits important economic activity to occur, and which improves opportunities for development of the cruise terminal area. \n\n\nCruise ship terminal project has certain specific requirement. The most fundamental is a cruise terminal location, where enough quay space would be provided, and where adequate services and activities which facilitate and complement the main activity can be located.\n\n\nThe study of Architectural plan for international cruise ship terminal indicates an important need for the regeneration and re-use of pier 1,2 areas, buildings and spaces at pusan port. \n\n\nThe pier 1,2 area today have the capacity to accommodate some of state-of-the-art cruise vessels. Pusan would become a home port and provide fly/cruise holiday programmes. \n\n\nThese goals can only be achieved through the development and management of state-of-the-art facilities for international cruise passenger handling. These facilities would have to be supported by other commercial activities and services which would support Pusan's attempt to cruise terminal development. \n\n\nRecent years have seen considerable investment in infrastructure, the appropriate international levels of passenger handling still needs to be improved in order to achieve the main goal of becoming a hub. International cruise ship terminal in pusan port is therefore needed, which facilities the handling of passengers, offers the required shelter, and incorporates excellent customer services. \n\n\nIt is realised that it is very difficult to become a cruise hub by just offering passenger handling facilities. These are two reasons for this. The first is that the facility has to cater for the different requirements of its users, including accommodation, entertainment and recreational needs.\n\n\nSecondly, the financial feasibility of the project requires that supplementary facilities are provided to generate long term revenue needed to offset to the infrastructural costs which have to be spent up front.\n\n\nThe concept of becoming a hub for cruise shipping entails having good connections with the airport.\n\n\nThe existing level of access to the area can generally be described to be poor. The pier1,2 is not attractive, the road is dangerous, and most importantly, there is a lack of activities which appeal to the general public. \n\n\nThe proximity of port related storage and industrial activities reinforce this negative impression given to anyone visiting the area for the first time. The architecture planning for international cruise ship terminal must therefore aim at changing this image of pusan through development plan which enhance the waterfront qualities in pusan.목차\n\n\n1. 서론 = 1\n\n\n 1.1 연구배경 및 목적 = 1\n\n\n  1.1.1 연구배경 = 1\n\n\n  1.1.2 연구목적 = 2\n\n\n 1.2. 연구내용 및 방법 = 4\n\n\n  1.2.1 연구내용 = 4\n\n\n  1.2.2 연구방법 = 4\n\n\n2. 국제 크루즈 터미널 현황 = 7\n\n\n 2.1. 북미 크루즈 터미널 개발 사례 = 7\n\n\n  2.1.1 커네버럴항(Port Canaveral)의 크루즈 터미널 = 7\n\n\n  2.1.2. 시애틀 벨스트리트 피어와 Pier9 = 13\n\n\n  2.1.3. 에버글래이드 크루즈터미널 개발 = 19\n\n\n  2.1.4. 샌프란시스코항 = 26\n\n\n  2.1.5. 샌디에고항 = 27\n\n\n 2.2. 벤쿠버 크루즈 터미널 개발사례 = 29\n\n\n  2.2.1. 벤쿠버 크루즈 터미널 = 29\n\n\n  2.2.2 벤쿠버 크루즈 터미널 확장계획 = 34\n\n\n 2.3. 유럽 크루즈 여객선 터미널 개발사례 = 35\n\n\n  2.3.1 벨레타(Valletta) 크루즈 터미널 = 35\n\n\n  2.3.2 도버(Dover) 크루즈 터미널 개발 = 40\n\n\n 2.4. 동남아시아 크루즈선 터미널의 = 42\n\n\n  2.4.1. 홍콩 오션 터미널(Hong Kong Ocean terminal) = 42\n\n\n  2.4.2. 싱가폴 터미널(Singapore Cruise Center) = 43\n\n\n  2.4.3 방콕 터미널 = 45\n\n\n3. 크루즈 터미널 계획 기법분석 = 47\n\n\n 3.1 샌프란시스코 크루즈 터미널계획 = 47\n\n\n  3.1.1 샌프란 시스코 Pier 35 시설 분？？ = 47\n\n\n  3.1.2 샌프란시스코 피어 27/29 계획 = 49\n\n\n  3.1.3 샌프란 시스코 Pier 30/32 터미널 계획 = 53\n\n\n 3.2. 오산바시(Osanbasi) 크루즈 터미널계획 기법 = 56\n\n\n  3.2.1 오산바시 크루즈 여객선 터미널 현황 = 57\n\n\n  3.2.2 터미널 평면 및 부두단면 = 61\n\n\n  3.2.3 여객 터미널의 기능분석 = 63\n\n\n 3.3. 벤쿠버 크루즈 터미널 계획기법 = 67\n\n\n  3.3.1. 크루즈 터미널 개발 현황 = 67\n\n\n  3.3.2 터미널 면적산정 = 69\n\n\n  3.3.3 크루즈 터미널 건물의 형태와 높이 = 70\n\n\n  3.3.4 공공 오픈 스페이스 = 71\n\n\n 3.4. 기타 크루즈 기항지의 터미널 계획 = 73\n\n\n  3.4.1 탐파(Tampa) 크루즈 터미널 = 73\n\n\n  3.4.2 웰링턴(Wellington)크루즈 터미널 = 74\n\n\n  3.4.3 스테이션(Station) 피어 = 75\n\n\n  3.4.4 쇼 피어(show pier) 여객선 터미널 = 78\n\n\n4. 부산항 국제 크루즈선 터미널 건축계획 = 81\n\n\n 4.1. 부산항 터미널 개발현황 = 81\n\n\n 4.2 부산항 1,2 부두 현황 = 83\n\n\n  4.2.1 토지 이용체제 = 83\n\n\n  4.2.2 제한된 부두 공간 = 87\n\n\n  4.2.3 입출국 수속 = 87\n\n\n 4.3 부산항 국제 크루즈 터미널 계획방향 = 87\n\n\n  4.3.1 기본계획 방향 = 87\n\n\n  4.3.2 국제 크루즈항 인프라 구축 = 89\n\n\n  4.3.3 부산항 국제 크루즈 터미널 건축계획 방향 = 92\n\n\nV. 결론 = 10",

    "title": "Legal Protection of a seaman according to termination of seaman-employment relationship",
    "description": "World each nation recognizes the importance of the marine that is future resources treasure and is going ahead with various policies. That is, It is not too much to say that ocean power is important because of a geographical position that is a peninsula surrounded by sea on three sides and insufficiency of natural resources to improve nation wealth and quality of people life through securing marine resource to accomplish nation development. In order to recognizes the importance the marine, and to accomplish nation development and growth, various policies and will of people and an administrator are important, but among those, seaman is most important. No matter how much a ship and the capital are healthy, maritime affairs and fisheries industrial cannot be run in case of seaman is not exist, or ability of him is short.\n\n\nBy the way, in spite of the importance of seaman's role how is the real position of seaman in our country? Is because the attraction of a seaman occupation's decline the competitiveness of the marine corporation and nation is getting worse according to an elevation of national income and a change of social sense of value? What is the first policy to resolve these problem? In a word, It is attraction of seaman occupation. That is, before retirement consideration of labor should be compensated by improving employment conditions after retirement. The right of seaman shouted be protected to acquire the base of new life.\n\n\nThis paper purpose of study is the inducement of attraction of seaman occupation by protecting the right to the retirement seamen, inducing a long time boarding to the boarding seamen and seelxing seamen occupation to the retired seamen though indicating the policies of the protection of the seaman's right after retirement the problem related to those, and the reform measures. This paper summary is below\n\n\nPrimarily seaman labor exists structural and quantitative specialty compared with land labor. Thfoerere, seaman must be specially protected employment conditions, continuation guarantee of labor relationship, rights guarantee after labor relationship extinction etc. Also, the same labor must be evaluated the same judge's robe so long as a common denominator called specialty of marine labor exists. Therefore, application range of the existing seaman act must be expanded.\n\n\nSecond it is a special nature of the provision of th termination seaman employment's. It is not simply to mean severance of labor, and it is loss of the opportunity of being provided labor to ship owner, and that of receiving wages to seamen. therefore it has a great influence on parties, it is necessary to regulate the employment relationship and to reform the problem.\n\n\n1. It is a discharge provision on the seaman act. It is necessary to express clearly the provision of transfer ship and to revise the provision of the time limit of discharge, exception related to a notice of discharge and the permission of labor committee according to assignment of the ship. \n\n\n2. It is thing about discharge on management. because of inconsistency with the seaman act it is reasonable to revise the provision of the seaman act and to take the legislative measure instead of introducing the discharge on management.\n\n\n3. It is an exception provision about the termination according to passage of the ship title and official reprimand of leaving a ship. Among these official reprimand of leaving a ship of a captain gives a lot of disadvantage to individual rights of a seaman, but the carries no legal binding force when a seaman does not leave a ship voluntarily. Therefore, it is reasonable to repeal official reprimand of leaving a ship and to provide the leaving a ship that is legal binding to captain. the exceptional provision about the the employment termination according to a charge of ship ownership should be revisied toward the aspect of employment guarantee of a seaman and resolveness of financial difficulties of a shipowner.\n\n\n4. If it is the exceptional provision of the point of the time of termination in case of on boarding employment relationship is terminated. it is necessary to revise toward taking considerations of the disadvantages of a seaman and the peace of the ship-community.\n\n\nThirdly, it is the problem of the legal protection of the seaman according to the seaman employment termination and reform measure. the problem of perfect the retired seaman and his family is important to the boarding seaman, retired seaman and to the reserved seaman. Nonetheless the existing seaman act and a related legal system are short of protecting the right of them the reform measure are below\n\n\n1. Because the retirement allowance system is not enough for inductance of longtime boarding and protection of a seaman in spite of the existence value of it, it is necessary to introduces an seaman pension system and to revise the provision of the retirement allowance system on the seaman act for the seaman who is not able to receive the pension benefit.\n\n\n2. overdue wages, rights about unemployment, rights about a disaster compensation are not more enough than a worker on labor standard law. These rights are things related to employment conditions of seamans substantially, and it is proper to revises seaman insurance law and to take legislative actions because it is to be related to a social insurance system of a seaman. A seaman is the same constitutional worker and people as a worker on labor standards law, but seaman is not able to receive the benefit of social security system. A maintenance of these policies is an unconstitutionality and cannot induce attraction of a seaman occupation. Therefore, in consideration of special nature marine labor, it is urgent to amend in order to receive the benefit of seaman insurance law above the level of benefit of the worker on labor standards law.\n\n\n3. It is the provision about the repatriation of a seaman that is unique only in the seaman employment relationship. The existing seaman act considers specialty of marine labor and is putting a repatriation provision, but it is short to consider the position of a seaman and is not enough for a foreign legislation level. Therefore, the provision about repatriation on the seaman act must be revised toward reflecting the intention of a seaman and preserving the profit of a seaman.\n\n\nUntil now welfare policy about the seaman has a lot of problems as above. if there is not a seaman we are not able to strengthen ocean fisheries industry and the competitiveness of nation. Therefore, special measures about legal protection of seaman according to the termination of seaman employment relationship in order to preserve the right of them and to resolve manpower problem of seaman occupation .목차\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\n第1章 序論 = 1\n\n\n 第1節 硏究의 目的 = 1\n\n\n 第2節 硏究의 方法과 範圍 = 4\n\n\n第2章 船員勤勞關係의 特殊性과 終了의 問題點 = 5\n\n\n 第1節 船員勤勞關係의 特殊性 = 6\n\n\n  I. 勞動行爲의 本質的 特殊性 = 6\n\n\n  II. 勞動行爲의 評價的 特殊性 = 10\n\n\n 第2節 船員勤勞關係 終了의 問題點 = 12\n\n\n  I. 論議의 前提 = 12\n\n\n  II. 船員勤勞關係의 終了事由에 관련된 問題點 = 14\n\n\n  III. 船員勤勞關係 終了後 船員의 法的保護에 관련된 問題點 = 18\n\n\n第3章 船員勤勞關係의 終了事由 = 22\n\n\n 第1節 民法規定이 適用되는 終了事由 = 23\n\n\n  I. 合意解止 및 辭職 = 24\n\n\n  II. 船員勤勞契約期間의 滿了 = 28\n\n\n 第2節 勤勞基準法과 共通的인 終了事由 = 32\n\n\n  I. 船員勤勞關係에 있어서 解雇의 正當한 事由 = 33\n\n\n  II. 船員法上 解雇規定의 問題點과 改善方向 = 42\n\n\n 第3節 勤勞基準法의 規定에 의한 終了事由 = 51\n\n\n  I. 船員法과 勤勞基準法의 關係 = 52\n\n\n  II. 經營上 解雇의 導入問題와 立法的 對處方案 = 55\n\n\n 第4節 船員法上 獨自的 終了事由 = 58\n\n\n  I. 船長의 下船懲戒權 = 59\n\n\n  II. 船舶所有權의 變更 = 67\n\n\n 第5節 船員法上 船員勤勞關係의 終了時點 = 82\n\n\n  I. 船員勤勞關係의 終了時點에 대한 例外事由 = 83\n\n\n  II. 問題點과 改善方向 = 86\n\n\n第4章 船員勤勞關係의 終了後 船員의 法的保護 = 88\n\n\n 第1節 一般勤勞關係와 동등한 수준으로 保護되는 權利 = 88\n\n\n  I. 船員法上 退職金制度의 特殊性 = 89\n\n\n  II. 船員法上 退職金制度의 問題點과 改善方向 = 93\n\n\n 第2節 一般勤勞關係보다 미흡한 수준으로 保護되는 權利 = 106\n\n\n  I. 滯拂賃金에 관한 權利 = 107\n\n\n  II. 失業에 관한 權利 = 126\n\n\n  III. 災害補償에 관한 權利 = 140\n\n\n 第3節 船員勤勞關係에서만 인정되는 權利 = 163\n\n\n  I. 船員法上 送還規定의 內容 = 164\n\n\n  II. 船員法上 送還規定의 問題點과 改善方向 = 167\n\n\n第5章 結論 = 172\n\n\n參考文獻 = 18",

    "title": "Molecular Biological and Ecological Investigation of PCBs Biodegradation Facilitated by Plant Terpenes",
    "description": "본 연구에서는 천연적으로 식물에서 합성이 이루어지며 자연계에 광범위하게 존재하는 식물 테르핀 (terpenes) 가 PCBs 및 천연 할로겐화 물질이 호기성 상태의 PCBs로 오염된 토양의 환경친화적 처리에 있어서 이러한 추가기질로서 어떤 역할을 하는지를 분자생물학적 및 생태학적 기법을 이용하여 규명하고자 하였다. \n\n\n우선적으로, 2종의 PCB 분해균주에서 테르핀 (carvone) 에 의해 PCB 분해경로가 유도된다는 사실을 생화학적 및 분자생물학적 기법들을 이용하여 밝혀내었다. Carvone에 의한 Ralstonia eutropha H850의 bphC 유전자의 발현결과는 H850의 토양내에서의 발현추적에 도움이 될 것이다.\n\n\n이러한 연구결과를 바탕으로 테르핀 (carvone, limonene, terpinene 등) 를 처리한 토양에 H850 균주를 접종하여 관찰한 결과, 최소한 2개월 이상 존재할 수 있음을 밝혔다. 그리고 처리구별 토양 총 RNA를 추출하여 RT-PCR을 통해 bphC 유전자의 mRNA 발현을 조사한 결과 비페닐 처리구 (4일째)에서 그 유전자가 발현됨을 밝혔다. 그러나 테르핀 처리구에서는 유전자의 발현이 나타나지 않은 것으로 보아 계면활성제의 처리？？ 통한 생물이용율을 증가시킬시 유전자의 발현 촉진, 그리고 지속적 기질 첨가 효과를 검토할 필요가 있었다. 이러한 이유로 계면활성제 sorbitan trioleate의 토양첨가실험을 실시하였다. 그 실험을 통해 sorbitan trioleate는 PCBs 분해균의 성장기질로 사용되어지는 것을 확인할 수 있었으며 또한 그 균주에 대한 독성도 없는 것으로 나타났다. 따라서 본 계면활성제가 분해균의 초기 밀도를 높이고 그 후 테르핀이 PCBs 분해 유전자의 발현을 촉진할 경우 그 분해효과는 극대화될 것으로 판단되며 이는 현장 적용시 상당한 이점으로 작용할 수 있을 것이다.\n\n\n또한 자연의 성장 기질 또는 유도물질로서 식물 테르핀이 PCB congeners에 어떠한 생분해 영향을 주는가에 대한 연구도 이루어졌다. PCB 분해자인 Rhodococcus sp. P166와 Rhodococcus sp. T104는 비페닐과 테르핀 ((S)-(-)-limonene, p- cymene，α-terpinene)을 성장기질로 이용함을 밝혀내었다. 그리고 congener 분해시험에서 (S)-(-)-limonene, p-cymene와 α-terpinene에서 키운 strain T104가 비페닐에 성장한 분해율의 50% 에 해당하는 30%까지 4,4'-DCBp를 분해시킬 수 있음을 보여주었다. 더구나 (S)-(-) limonene을 이용하여 ？眉？ 균주 T104 또한 2,2'-DCBp를 30%까지 분해시킬 수 있음을 확인하였다. 따라서 본 연구는 자연에 널리 존재하는 테르핀이 PCB 분해균의 성장기질로서 사용되어 그 분해유전자가 유도되며 그 결과 PCB의 congener를 기질 특이적으로 분해할 수 있음을 보여주었다. 이것은 기존의 순수 PCBs 분해 균주의 resting cell assay를 통한 meta ring fission 과 비교해 볼 때 환경시료(부산항 저질자료 제시하지 않음)에서 농화배양으로 분리한 균주의 성장기질로서, 유도체로서 사용됨을 실험으로 확인할 수 있었고 이 연구에서 설정한 가설이 틀리지 않았음을 증명할 수 있었다.목차\n\n\nTable of Contents = i\n\n\nList of Tables = iv\n\n\nList of Figures = v\n\n\nABSTRACT = viii\n\n\nI.

    "title": "A retrospective study on African American experiences of witnessing male to female intimate partner violence (IPV) as low-income youth and the impact on adolescent self-identity and development",
    "description": "This qualitative retrospective study examined lived experiences of African American males and females whom witnessed male to female intimate partner violence (IPV) as low-income youth. Race, class, experience of witnessing IPV, and impact on self-identity and development were explored to gain a more in-depth understanding of the collective meaning of these variables to participants. Few studies in the field of couple and family therapy have focused on IPV, particularly in African Americans (Avis, 1992; Bograd, 1999; McDowell & Jeris, 2004). Thus this study endeavored to contribute to the family therapy literature on IPV and African Americans. Ten African American adult males and females from low-income backgrounds were sampled using semi-structured interviews. Developmental-ecological theory was the theoretical framework for this study and data analysis was conducted utilizing a retrospective integrative phenomenological approach (Giorgi, 1997; Moustakas, 1994; van Manen, 1990). Findings revealed the following: loss of safety; feelings of helplessness though some participants tried to protect their mothers/caregivers despite the danger; growing up quickly and loss of childhood; independence; and issues in adolescence (violence in dating relationships, emotional distress and risky behaviors). Further, participants reported that it was very difficult to be a low-income youth due to their exposure to violence, poverty, and other dangerous situations within the community. Consequently, there was a large impact on participants’ self-identity and development. Participants saw themselves as products of their environment, specifically since they not only had to deal with the structural inequities of being low-income but also African American. Remarkably, participants attributed their resiliency and tenacity to negative experiences and believed they were better individuals because of them.Ph.D., Individual, Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "The Relational Effects of Mindfulness Training: A Phenomenological Study",
    "description": "Using General Systems Theory (Bertalanffy, 1968) and Phenomenology (Husserl, 1913/1931), this qualitative phenomenological study examined the relational effects of mindfulness training when one partner completed an 8-week, hospital based Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR, Kabat-Zinn, 1990) within the last 6 months. In a sample of 12 couples, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with: a) recent MBSR graduates, b) their intimate partners, and c) both members of the couple together. The recent MBSR graduates were novel meditators who had limited previous mindfulness experience before taking the MBSR training and included 7 female and 6 male MBSR graduates. Ten heterosexual couples and 2 same sex couples participated in the study, and the average relationship length was 14.5 years. Over 95% of the participants were White, and 62.5% had graduate degrees. Before the interviews, all couples completed the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Busby et al., 1995), which indicated that 6 out of 12 couples were relationally distressed. A modified version of the interpretative phenomenological analysis method (Smith et al., 2009) informed the data analysis. The following major themes emerged for the MBSR graduates: 1) awareness of emotional reactivity; 2) creating space and time; 3) making different choices; and 4) humility and moments of connection. Findings confirmed that self-awareness and emotional regulation are not only major outcomes of mindfulness training, but could also be pathways to relationship growth. The intensity and reactivity of intimate partner relationships can offer both opportunities and challenges for MBSR participants trying to integrate mindfulness into their daily lives. Although intimate partners observed improved emotional balance in the graduates, their descriptions of the benefits of MBSR training were diluted compared to the graduates' descriptions. The intimate partners revealed that behavioral shifts in the graduates were emerging, but were limited in scale--suggesting that individual outcomes of MBSR training do not automatically transfer to relationship outcomes. Developing more mindfulness-enhanced couple interventions that prioritize conjoint participation and emphasize relational outcomes may harness the potential relational benefits of mindfulness practice. Future research should focus on the potential differences between distressed and non-distressed couples and include more diverse samples of couples.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201",

    "title": "A Study on the Electronic Bills of Lading",
    "description": "After the middle of 20TH century, Electronic commerce is now becoming prevalent rapidly. And the development of transport techniques and environmental changes in international trade has caused many problems concerning the use of traditional Bills of Lading.\n\n\nIn particular, modern and efficient methods of transportation have in effect become commodity services in most parts of the developed world as a result of the introduction of the container in the 1960's due to as above situation one of transport documents of Bills of Lading face with crisis in the international trade.\n\n\nSo, Traditional Bills of Lading has tended to become an obstacle to the development of trade and in the end restricting the expeditious flow of goods for solve Bills of Lading's crisis international trade.\n\n\nTherefore, Today's Bills of Lading is requested its change.\n\n\nThe one aspect is the crisis of Bills of Lading, one of the most important documents and the typical systems, which is produced for commercial products. Bills of Lading plays an important role as currency trades and a indispensable document in international trading, it is working as a receipt of the goods, as a document of title, and as a evidence of contract, therefore the consignee of goods must introduce a Bill of Lading to accept the goods, but the current situation in international trade, the goods arrived at their destination before Bills of Lading, because of transport technology development which represented by the development of containerization and the turn up of the fast container ship.\n\n\nThe flow of goods was more faster by two progresses of technology, but the flow of Bills of Lading was not developed and passed through the bank to examine the document in letter of credit transactions.\n\n\nThe other aspect is the rapid introduction of Electronic data interchange(EDI) system. Today, as electronic data interchange system comes into a wide use, international trade which has been traditionally carried out with documents is gradually being transformed into a paperless transaction.\n\n\nThe Bills of Lading can also be issued electronically, it can therefore be easily expected that, by the introduction of EDI system, the paper Bills of Lading will soon disappear in practice and the efficiency in international transaction be promoted. The use of EDI is more effective, cheaper and more rapid than paper document system. Thus the environment of trade was changed by EDI.\n\n\nHowever, Other trade documents can be replaced by EDI messages without problem, but the Bills of Lading has several impediments in converting EDI message. Because Bills of Lading is a document of title, therefore Electronic Bills of Lading has to prove the right.\n\n\nTo encourage the use of Electronic Bills of Lading , CMI Uniform Rules for the Electronic Bills of Lading was enacted in 1990 and other related international rules were revised to in corporate the use of Electronic Bills of Lading. Despite there international efforts to promote the use of Electronic Bills of Lading, the actual utilization in practice has been very minimal, due to various problems and limitations.\n\n\nIn order to proliferation of Electronic Bills of Lading, legal confirmation is needed. That is to say Electronic Bills of Lading must has the same legal status as the existing Bills of Lading in the aspect of international regulations. But current situation, Electronic Bills of Lading is not a new form of Bills of Lading a kind of contract which governs carriage of goods by sea.\n\n\nThe legal problems of Electronic Bills of Lading are evidential issue of EDI such as request of writing, authentication, electronic signature, and contractual issue of EDI transactions, liability issues of the parties.\n\n\nEven though Bolero(Bills of Lading Electronic Registry Organization) international developed the Bolero style Bills of Lading among some of europe countries and shipping companies, it couldn't settle above problems in Electronic Bills of Lading.\n\n\nDespite the fact that paper transactions have gradually been transformed into EDI system, it may not be possible that the paper Bills of Lading will fully be substituted by electronic one owing to the inherent nature of Bills of Lading as being the document of title.\n\n\nFor the full utilization of Electronic Bills of Lading, therefore this study brings focus to the solution of Bills of Lading crisis and looks into the legal problems and seeks new legislation about Electronic Bills of Lading.목차\n\n\n第1章 序論 = 1\n\n\n 第1節 硏究의 目的 = 1\n\n\n 第2節 硏究의 範圍 및 方法 = 3\n\n\n第2章 電子式 船荷證券의 意義와 出現 背景 = 5\n\n\n 第1節 電子式 船荷證券의 意義 = 5\n\n\n  I.

    "title": "A Study on the Problems and Effects of U.S.A Shipping Policy Related Acts",
    "description": "This paper is regarding the Problems and Effects of U.S.A Shipping Policy Related Acts against worldwide shipping market. We have a longtime good relationship with U.S.A in various fields as well as shipping parts. And U.S.A shipping acts have impacted on worldwide shipping including Korea's.\n\n\nThis subject focus on attaining five purposes 1) The history of U.S.A Shipping Acts. 2) Shipping Act of 1984. 3) The U.S Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998. 4) The Problems and Effects of U.S.A Shipping Policy Related Acts. 5) The Korea shipping countermeasure against U.S.A Shipping Act.\n\n\nThis study consists of six chapters. The first chapter reads a general introduction of this subject. The second chapter, the review of the history of U.S.A shipping acts as in age order with Shipping Acts and Merchant Marine Acts respectively.\n\n\nThe third chapter lay out the descriptions of Shipping Act of 1984, and the effects on the world shipping market. And then, the fourth chapter concentrate on the U.S Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, from that it was passed by Congress and signed into law in October 1998. its provisions take effect May 1, 1999. The fifth chapter critically reviews in current U.S.A shipping act's injustice aspects. and propose the countermeasure to cope with current U.S.A shipping act. finally, the last chapter offers a conclusion to this paper. \n\n\nThe America shipping policy is consisted in Shipping act and Merchant Marine Act which are two public law scheme. However, they don't distinguish them each other. Shipping act is for externally enacting America shipping policy specially against shipping conference and worldwide shipping market. Merchant Marine Act interiorly purposed the America shipping industry promotion.\n\n\nThe shipping act of 1916 was the first United States legislation which was used to regulate the practices of steamship liners serving within the United States. \n\n\nAnd then, it was adjusted into shipping act of 1961, newly the shipping act of 1984 was legislated to establish a nondiscriminatory regulatory process for the common carriage of goods by water in the foreign commerce of the United States with a minimum of government intervention and regulatory costs, and to provide an efficient and transportation system in the ocean commerce of the United States that is, insofar as possible, in harmony with, and responsive to, international shipping practices, and to encourage the development of an economically sound and efficient United States-flag liner fleet capable of meeting national security needs.\n\n\nAlso it was reformed into 'the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998', and the purpose was added 'To promote the growth and development of United States exports through competitive and efficient ocean transportation and by placing a greater reliance on the marketplace.'\n\n\nCurrently, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 modifying the shipping Act of 1984 is coming into effect in worldwide shipping market. \n\n\nIt has many injustice aspects as follows.\n\n\n1) It's excessive a protective policy to the United States shipping liners. Therefore, FMC restricts the worldwide shipping market and oversea shipping liners.\n\n\n2) The shipping liners should concentrate on U.S.A shipping acts in order to avoid violation.\n\n\n3) Conference lost freight and market adjustment ability with the effectuation of shipping act of 1984 and OSRA, Therefore, if the market slow down, they may be liable to cause property damage.\n\n\n4) The medium and small size shippers have a tough in the recent shipping market with the effectuation of shipping act of 1984 and OSRA\n\n\n5) NVOCC will not be allowed to offer service contracts. Consequently, they are less competitive than common carriers.\n\n\nThe Korea liner companies have to overcome U.S.A shipping acts in this situation as following strategies. Firstly, they must meet the needs of the times on computerization age in global network fields. And then, shippers have to try to get more information on freight, liner service and so on. Also, they must organize shipper's association in order to contract more competitive freight and service condition with Liner.목차\n\n\n第1障 序論 = 6\n\n\n 第1節 硏究의 目的 = 6\n\n\n 第2節 硏究의 方法 및 範圍 = 7\n\n\n第2障 海運政策 關聯法의 沿革 = 10\n\n\n 第1節 海運政策의 方向 = 10\n\n\n 第2節 1916年 以前의 海運政策 關聯法 = 13\n\n\n 第3節 海運法 = 16\n\n\n  1. 1916년 해운법(Shipping Act of 1916) = 16\n\n\n  2. 1961년 해운법(Shipping Act of 1961) = 18\n\n\n  3. 1978년 해운법(Ocean Shipping Act of 1978) = 20\n\n\n  4. 1984년 해운법(Shipping Act of 1984) = 21\n\n\n  5. 1998년 미국외항해운개혁법(U.S Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998) = 21\n\n\n 第4節. 商船法 = 22\n\n\n  1. 1920년 상선법(Merchant Marine Act of 1920) = 22\n\n\n  2. 1936년 상선법(Merchant Marine Act of 1936) = 23\n\n\n  3. 1946년 상선법(The Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946) = 24\n\n\n  4. 1970년 상선법(Merchant Marine Act of 1970) = 25\n\n\n第3障 1984年 海運法의 內容과 影響 = 27\n\n\n 第1節. 立法 背景 = 27\n\n\n 第2節 主要 內容 = 28\n\n\n  1. 84년 해운법의 제정목적 = 28\n\n\n  2. 獨占禁止法 適用免除 = 28\n\n\n  3. 獨自行動權(Independent Action : I/A)의 도입 = 30\n\n\n  4. 貨物優待運賃(Time/Volume Rate : TVR)의 도입 = 31\n\n\n  5. 優待運送契約(Service Contract : S/C)의 도입 = 32\n\n\n  6. 二重運賃契約制의 실질적 금지 = 33\n\n\n  7. 미국선사의 보호 = 34\n\n\n  8. 국영선사의 통제 = 34\n\n\n  9. 荷主團體(SA)의 인정 = 35\n\n\n  10. 無船舶運送人(NVOCC)의 법적 지위 인정 = 36\n\n\n  11. 해운동맹자문위원 = 36\n\n\n 第3節. 外航定期船 海運市場에 미치는 影響 = 37\n\n\n  1. 해운동맹에 미친 영향 = 37\n\n\n  2. 선박대형화의 촉진 = 40\n\n\n  3. 하주에 미친 영향 = 41\n\n\n  4. 복합운송에 미친 영향 = 42\n\n\n第4障 1998年 外航海運改革法의 內容과 影響 = 43\n\n\n 第1節. 制定 背景과 特徵 = 43\n\n\n 第2節 內容 = 45\n\n\n  1. 法의 執行機關 = 45\n\n\n  2. 태리프(Tariff) 申告 및 免除品目 = 46\n\n\n  3. 테리프(Tariff) 申告機關 및 申告方法 = 47\n\n\n  4. 置運賃還割引 및 二重運賃契約制 = 48\n\n\n  5. 荷主差別待遇 = 48\n\n\n  6. 優待運送契約 (Service Contract) = 49\n\n\n  7. 내륙운송비협상 = 51\n\n\n  8. 운임동맹의 태리프(Tariff) 및 優待運送契約(S/C)에 관한 獨自行動權(I/A) = 51\n\n\n  9. 미국선사보호 = 52\n\n\n  10. 海上貨物 및 運送周旋人, 無船舶運送人(NOVCC) = 52\n\n\n  11. 기타 변경 사항 = 54\n\n\n 第4節. 外航定期船 海運市場에 미치는 影響 = 55\n\n\n  1. 해운규제의 완화 = 55\n\n\n  2. 하주의 교섭력 증대 = 56\n\n\n  3. 해운동맹의 붕괴 및 신협조체제 등장 = 57\n\n\n  4.

    "title": "Design and Implementation of XML based Data Replication Web Agent between Heterogeneous DBMSs",
    "description": "XML(eXtensible Markup Language) has recently emerged as a new standard for data representation and exchange on the Internet. Web servers and applications encoding their data in XML can quickly make their information available in a simple and usable format, and such information providers can inter- operate easily. Information content is separated from information rendering, making it easy to provide multiple views of the same data. XML data files can be rendered via specifications in XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language). Most of us are familiar with web sites that contain vast databases of useful information, but whose query and search facilities are surprisingly primitive. \n\n\nThis paper proposes web agent for data replication between heterogeneous DBMSs(Database Management System). Web agent system manages database on the web and exchanges data in heterogeneous database using XML. \n\n\nUsing web page, user sends to web server information about database, web server creates query sentence for database connection. Using created query sentence, web server exchanges data with database server. \n\n\nWeb server makes XML document from source database data, XML document saves destination database. Using this way, web agent system exchange data between databases. So, this web agent system manage database data on the web, exchange data between heterogeneous DBMSs.목차\n\n\n요약 = ii\n\n\n제1장 서론 = 1\n\n\n제2장 확장성 생성 언어(XML) = 3\n\n\n 2.1 SGML과 HTML의 한계 = 3\n\n\n 2.2 XML의 개요 및 특징 = 4\n\n\n 2.3 활용분야 = 9\n\n\n 2.4.

    "title": "Design and Implementation of a SMIL-based Web Editor for Multimedia Teaching Aids",
    "description": "As WWW becomes the representative service of Internet, HTML has revealed it's limitation on processing multimedia data. Many other techniques - like DHTML and Java - were introduced. They, however causes heavy traffics on the network and overhead on web browsers. The Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) is a recommendation from the W3C that makes authoring of TV-like multimedia presentations on the Web easier. It is derived from the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) to define a set of markup tags to synchronize the timing and positioning relationships between multimedia objects. This paper presents the design and implementation of a SMIL-based web editor. The proposed editor handles well the temporal and spatial synchronized information among multimedia objects. It was, especially designed for multimedia teaching aids. The easy user interface and convenient tools are the essential needs for the teachers unfamiliar to the multimedia authoring. Then the user interface with WYSIWYG and Drag & Drop is the main theme in designing the SMIL editor. Now novice users are able to make complicated multimedia presentation in more ease and convenience.Abstract = ⅱ\n\n\n제 1 장 서론 = 1\n\n\n제 2 장 SMIL 소개 = 4\n\n\n제 3 장 SMIL 문서 에디터 설계 = 12\n\n\n  3.1 공간 정보 설정 = 12\n\n\n  3.2 시간 정보 설정 = 14\n\n\n  3.3 설정 정보의 저장 = 16\n\n\n제 4 장 구현 = 22\n\n\n  4.1 전체 구성 = 22\n\n\n    4.1.1 기본 메뉴와 툴바 = 24\n\n\n    4.1.2 탭 컨트롤 = 25\n\n\n  4.2 공간 정보 설정 윈도우 = 25\n\n\n    4.2.1 WYSIWYG 화면 = 26\n\n\n    4.2.2 상세 정보 설정 화면 = 27\n\n\n  4.3 시간 정보 설정 윈도우 = 28\n\n\n    4.3.1 멀티미디어 객체 추가 버튼 = 28\n\n\n    4.3.2 시간축 편집기 = 29\n\n\n  4.4 데이터베이스 = 31\n\n\n제 5 장 결론 = 33\n\n\n참고 문헌 = 3",

    "title": "(A) Study on the Alternatives to Traditional Bills of Lading related to Problems with It's Legal Effects in International Trade and Transportation",
    "description": "Bills of Lading, with their long history and legal position in the world shipping industry are still internationally acknowledged as the dinglische Wirkung or title to the goods. Furthermore, under the law forcing exchangeability for goods, even a contractual buyer is unable to claim delivery of goods from a carrier without presenting or exchanging an original bill of lading(B/L), Likewise the carrier is also unable to release the goods carried without original B/L. Given such legal limitations, however, the recent appearance of high speed ships in ocean shipping has shortened the transit time resulting late release of goods due to the later arrival of documents than goods. Regarding this, usage of B/L could become rather an obstacle in delivering goods in time, causing waste time and unnecessary expenses to the consignee. There has been some discussions of how to eliminate such inconvenience and problems but most of them do not conform to reality. Recently, among alternatives to traditional B/L, the most plausible methods are the SWB and electronic B/L. However due to their short history, they are not yet legally recognized under Korean law nor international conventions or rules use of nonnegotiable Sea Waybill(SWB) and discussions on how to fulfil the functions of B/L electronically come about, however, due to their short history, they alternatives are not yet legally specified neither by the Korean laws nor international conventions or rules. \n\n\nThe object of this thesis is to present not only SWB and electronic B/L as tools of solving above mentioned problems, but also to provide direction for what legislation will be necessary to support them. The research findings are summarized as follows : \n\n\n1. To Enhance the Usage of SWB \n\n\nAlthough SWB are occasionally used in Korea because of foreign customers request, there is still lack of recognition and are not being researched in actual business setting. Moreover, there hasn't been any discussion on how to establish or revise of laws relating to SWB. Therefore, to promote the use of SWB on a stable basis, business procedures will need to be established and supporting legal systems will have to be prepared as follows : \n\n\n(1) The current commercial code should include, a definition of SWB containing its legal character, provision of cargo delivery, provision of shipper's right to control of goods shipped, effect of SWB and provision of mutatis mutandis application of relative provisions for B/L. \n\n\n(2) Standard forms including it's clauses(terms and conditions) that can be applied to practical business of using SWB need to be prepared. As SWB functions as the evidence of contract of liner sea transport, using long form would be recommendable. \n\n\n(3) Transactions without resale during the transportation can be carried on SWB. As for those on cash base or open account base, and D/A term among Collection base etc. where there is no problem settling payment for goods between reliable parties, and shipping document automatically released to the buyer regardless his concurrent payment and therefore in such transaction, SWB can be used instead of B/L. Thus, in short, SWB shall be used except for when B/L should be used due to unconditional requirements of the B/L as a functioning of title to the goods. SWB can be used as an alternative to B/L to overcome delays caused by faster transit time and B/L arriving later than goods. However, SWB has not been used widely because its actual application and legal position has yet been established in Korea. Also, even those concerned parties still do not clearly recognize the effect of using SWB and replacing current B/L with SWB is not common yet. Therefore, in order to improve the use of SWB, international transportation or trade authorities (i.e., the Shipowners Association, the International Freight Forwarders Association, Trade Association etc.), government agencies and research institutions or academic circles, need to encourage concerned parties to use SWB by conducting active studies and promotions. \n\n\n(4) When SWB are used, the person who requests delivery of goods should prove that he is the named consignee and the carrier may deliver the goods to him without exchanging the SWB. \n\n\n(5) Since SWB is not negotiable by endorsement and the parties concerned are limited to carrier, shipper and consignee, computerization is not so complicated. The purpose of using SWB is to eliminate B/L required in every stage and let the cargo information be given to those between shipper and carrier, among carriers at port of departure and destination or customs offices etc. which would eventually enable the consignee to receive cargo without presentation of document. Thus, replacing papers (e.g., Booking Request, Shipping Instructions, Carriers' confirmation for receipt of booking, preparation of SWB, Arrival Notice etc.) with EDI when using SWB would enhance convenience in exchanging information and promptness in cargo flow. \n\n\n2. To Activate the Electronic Bills of Lading \n\n\nOn the other hand, I would also suggest employment and activation of electronic negotiable bills of lading(e-B/L), performing the functions of document of title to the good. \n\n\n(1) This would require setting up legal backing for studies. Some attempts have been made to overcome the functional limits of negotiable B/L but practical application have yet to found. The reason is not because of computer technical problem but of legal problem. Korean laws such as the Commercial Code, Act on the Promotion of office Automation for Trade, Digital Signature Act are not directly applicable to e-B/L. Hence, for smooth electronic operation of B/L, provisions must be made that allow e-B/L to be regarded as a document of contract of carriage of goods by sea is necessary, like that of current B/L. To do this, provisions of the Exemption of Carrier's Liabilities(Korea Commercial Code, Article 789bis) and the Exemption of Prohibition of Lightening Liability (Art. 790) can be applicable. And the provisions such as the Issuance of B/L(Art. 813), Particulars to be stated in the B/L(Art. 814), Effects of B/L Description (Art. 814bis) can be applied or correspondingly applied to some limits. Moreover, provisions about the Exchangeability of B/L(Art.820 & 129), Sign and Deliver of B/L copy(Art. 815), Numerous original of B/L and Delivery of Goods at Port of Discharge(Art. 816), Numerous original of B/L and Delivery of Goods at Place other than the Port of Discharge(Art. 817) are undoubtedly inapplicable to e-B/L. In addition, a revision of the Promotion Act for Promotion of Trade Automation is also required for wider application limits of e-B/L. Furthermore, for international usage of e-B/L, establishment of a unified international laws, such as international convention or rules, is highly demanded. Untill these points are recognized legally, it can be operated under separate contracts among the concerned parties . \n\n\n(2) According to CMI Rules for Electronic Bills of Lading, the carrier is stipulated as the managing or controling body of e-B/L, but due to immanent problems of additional responsibility, cost, specialized human resource, technical installation and system know-how, the efficient managing body should be a neutral 3rd party administration. \n\n\n(3) As for e-B/L, besides amendment of consignee by changing the title of ownership, other corrections are unavoidable. There would be many different types of alteration including changing the terms and condition of contact of carriage(e.g., change of consignee and destination etc.), as well as minor spelling correction. Since the electronic transfer of title by Private Key Holder to others is the ultimate purpose of e-B/L, this is not a matter carrier shall interfere with. However, as the alteration of such content is related to B/L forgery and amending major contents of carriage of goods leads to change of rights and obligations of carriers, these changes must be done with the carriers' acceptance. What is more, the authority to amend e-B /L data should also be given to the carrier. \n\n\n3. To Utilize Substitutions as Shipping Document for Traditional Bills of Lading \n\n\nSWB and e-B/L are possible alternatives to current paper B/L. However, under the present conditions and circumstances, neither one is suitable enough to entirely replace whole paper B/L because paper B/L are still compulsory in some countries, not all trade parties have computer capacity, and transit times are often long enough to allow timely paper B/L arrival. So, even if e-B/L comes to wide usage, current paper B/L shall co-exist for long time. However, in order to lessen problems arising from paper B/L, I would strongly suggest the transactions without resale during the voyage be carried on non-negotiable SWB and those with expected resale and on a L/C base requiring security, be carried out under negotiable B/L. Currently limited usage of e-B/L is considered between parties with established relationships, for example, between specific neighboring countries and/or between companies in good standing. In case when documents are certain to arrive sooner than cargo, current paper B/L is just as good. However, all shipping documents should turnover to paperless electronic documentation which would eventually bring more efficiency and productivity.목차\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n第1章 序論\n\n\n 第1節 硏究의 目的 = 1\n\n\n 第2節 硏究의 範圍 및 方法 = 4\n\n\n第2章 現行 船荷證券制度의 運營上의 問題點 = 8\n\n\n 第1節 序說 = 8\n\n\n 第2節 船荷證券本質上의 問題 = 10\n\n\n  1. 船荷證券의 權利證券性에 따른 問題 = 10\n\n\n  2. 船荷證券의 相換證券性에 따른 問題 = 12\n\n\n 第3節 海上運送書類實務上의 問題 = 14 \n\n\n  1. 船荷證券이 화물보다 늦게 도착하는 問題 = 14\n\n\n  2. 船荷證券原本의 紛失問題 = 18\n\n\n  3. 保證渡의 問題 = 23 \n\n\n  4. 業務自動化 趨勢와 電子商去來環境의 擴散 = 33\n\n\n 第4節 傳統的 船荷證券制度의 問題解決을 위한 代替手段의 必要性 = 35\n\n\n  1. 船荷證券原本을 화물보다 먼저 目的地에 도착시키기 위한 방법 = 35\n\n\n  2. 船荷證券原本을 發行地 또는 船積地에 제출하는 방법 = 43 \n\n\n  3. 權利證券性 및 相換證券性이 없는 運送證券을 사용하는 방법 = 47\n\n\n  4. 船荷證券機能을 電子式으로 운영하는 방법 = 48\n\n\n第3章 Sea Waybill에 의한 運送 = 51\n\n\n 第1節 Sea Waybill에 관한 一般的 考察 = 51\n\n\n  1.

    "title": "An Architectural Design of a Conference System for Mobile Terminals",
    "description": "Recently the demands of the Internet services for the mobile environment are rapidly increasing with the growth of the Internet. Nevertheless, the technologies for the services are just in the beginning. A few simple services are only provided as compared with the diverse services on the wire-networked Internet. \t\t\n\n\nThe mobile devices are so handicapped in many ways that the technologies should be different with those for the desktop systems. A Small display, no keyboard, and the low bandwidth of the mobile network should be considered to develop the Internet services for the mobile environment. The Internet technologies such as mobile IP, WAP, WML, VoiceXML, and the mobile browsers are appeared for the mobile Internet services. \n\n\nIn this paper, the mobile Internet technologies are adapted to the audio teleconference service. Because the service is one of the most important Internet services, and also the mobile devices usually have the telephone functionalities, the service is going to be the killer application of the mobile Internet services.

    "title": "A Study of the Introduction of the Ship Investment Corporations System for Ship Financing",
    "description": "The Korean marine transportation industry accounts for 5% of the world's total transportation of goods (5.3billion tons) and it transported 99.7% of Korea's entire export and import with earning 11.3 billion dollars in 2000.\n\n\nThe securing of new and old ships which are an important basis of marine transportation industry has not been implemented since the foreign exchange crisis in 1997. The advanced countries are achieving competitiveness by securing stabilized shipping craft. The foreign exchange crisis triggered our country to consider to the introduction of the ship investment corporation system.\n\n\nThis study is to discuss the major benefits of the introduction of the ship investment corporation. Before discussing the introduction of the ship investment corporation, we will review our ship finance systems. And then we will examine systems the systems and operation results of Germany's K/G Fund and Norway's K/S Fund.\n\n\nWe have many kinds of ship finance, which are the planned shipbuilding system, BBCHP fund for introducing used shipping craft, and export fund. The planned shipbuilding, which has been developed as a policy of reinforcing shipping craft upon the basis of the five-year economic plan for connecting shipbuilding and marine transportation industry, has been given 80% of the fund for shipbuilding, based on the bringing up of marine transportation industry since 1976. This fund made a great contribution to the augmentation of shipping craft at the beginning of the domestic marine transportation industry. Shipping companies, however, avoided the use of the planned shipbuilding system because of the securing of the additional fund and high interest rate. As our country joined the OECD in 1996, this system has been abolished in the sector of the ocean-going ships, and 80% of total fund for the shipbuilding of home-waters liners has been provided. \n\n\nAs for the BBCHP, 100% loan for the cost of shipbuilding and various financial expenses can be borrowed from foreign financial institutions. The borrowers can pay back on equal installment basis over the period of 10~20 years and the ships transporting cargos for long-term contract basis have an advantage of securing ships without the investment of capital. Since the second half of 1980, about one billion dollars have been assigned for the ceiling of domestic shipbuilding responsibility and for the ceiling of the borrowing of fund from abroad. However, at the time of the foreign exchange crisis, the ceiling of the fund from abroad was abolished and the system has been changed so that a shipping company could borrow money on credit. It became possible for a shipping company having a lot of debts either to be unable to borrow money or to borrow money with high rate of interest. BBCHP fund for introducing used shipping craft has an advantage of securing ships within the short period of time.\n\n\nThere are various kinds of sources borrowing including loans, lease financing, the fund of the Bank of Korea. However, in most cases the foreign exchange of the Bank of Korea was utilized. Nevertheless, the lending of the foreign exchange of the Bank of Korea was suspended because of the foreign exchange crisis. The export fund of the Export and Import Bank is a system which foreign ships cannot be supported with this fund and foreign shipping companies utilizing the domestic shipbuilding yards can get this fund. Thus, Korean financial system of securing ships has a problem of flimsiness. \n\n\nThe American system of the financing for ships is to provide long-term financing on a low interest rate in order to expedite the growth and modernization of a body of merchant vessels and shipbuilding yards. The Japanese system of financing for ships is a Japan's planned shipbuilding system for reviving the body of the Japanese merchant vessels. This system has been introduced in order to reconstruct the body of merchant vessels by the government. Because of the government policy, Japan has become an advanced country in marine transportation and grown as a great country of shipbuilding.\n\n\nGermany's K/G(Kommandit Gessellschaft) is a fund which operates not only ships, but also real estate. Recently, real estate tends to be on the decline and ships tends to be gradually active. According to K/G Fund, the company investing in ships borrows fund from general public investors and financial institutions and invest them in ships. The companies operating ships cannot offer their profits as mortgage nor can they rent, nor can they transfer them. In case the company investing in ships or stockholders come to suffer damage, they should be jointly and severally responsible for the directors and auditors of the company operating ships and the related company operating ships. The company investing in ships should consign the task as keeping its assets to the company keeping assets, and the procedure and criteria keeping or taking out asset are to be decided by presidents's order.\n\n\nThe assets of the company investing in ships, the proper assets of the company keeping them, and the assets consigned by the third party should be managed separately. In case damage occurs to the company investing in ships and to stock holders, the company keeping assets is to be responsible for the damages. In order to secure the transparency in operation, the company investing in ships limits the number of ships to one ship to one company(single purpose company). K/G Fund is being operating on a long-term and stable basis in which the tax benefit is gradually bing swindled. It should be decided within 10 years after the delivery of a ship whether it is to be applied to tonnage tax, the ship should maintain German nationality for a decade.\n\n\nNorway's K/S(Kommandit Selskap) fund has been utilized in the field of marine transportation industry since 1920, and recently it has been made use of a lot in the field of real estate. K/S fund, a joint-venture company like K/G, applies 17% of high speed refunding. The period of continued existence of the Fund is two years for short term, so that it has a venture style management. Norway doesn't connect Tonnage Tax with K/S, but applies it to registered ships.\n\n\nAs we reviewed K/G and K/S funds, the introduction of the ship investment corporation system could contribute to promotion of the ship finance in Korea. We suggest some ideas to utilize the ship investment corporation in Korea. Firstly, it is necessary to introduce tonnage tax system for the successful introduction of the ship investment corporation. Secondly, the ship investment corporations provide the higher rate of return compared to others. Finally, the investment on ship should be recognized by investors as a safe investment instrument.목차\n\n\n[ABSTRACT] = v\n\n\n제1장 서론 = 1\n\n\n 제1절 연구 목적 = 1\n\n\n 제2절 연구방법 및 범위 = 2\n\n\n제2장 우리나라의 선박확보제도의 변천과정에 대한 개관 = 3\n\n\n 제1절 선박금융의 의의와 변천 = 3\n\n\n  1. 선박금융의 의의 = 3\n\n\n  2. 선박금융의 변천 = 8\n\n\n 제2절 우리나라의 선박확보제도의 현황과 문제점 = 12\n\n\n  1. 우리나라의 선박확보제도의 현황 = 12\n\n\n  2. 우리나라의 선박확보의 문제점 = 25\n\n\n제3장 주요국의 선박금융제도의 현황 및 비교분석 = 31\n\n\n 제1절 미국의 선박금융제도 = 31\n\n\n  1. 연방선박금융프로그램 = 31\n\n\n  2. 프로그램의 적용대상가 조건 = 33\n\n\n 제2절 일본의 선박금융제도 = 35\n\n\n  1. 계획조선제도 = 35\n\n\n  2. 시쿠미센과 일본상사금융 = 39\n\n\n 제3절 독일의 K/G Fund = 40\n\n\n  1. 개괄 = 40\n\n\n  2.

    "title": "A Study on the Image Recognition Algorithm and Control Module Implementation using Fuzzy Inference",
    "description": "Fuzzy inference is an important issue in research on the fuzzy set theory. Because of the suitability for representing uncertain values, fuzzy numbers have been widely used in many applications.\n\n\nIn this paper proposed detecting specific position of the object using fuzzy inference and image processing. \n\n\nRecently instead of classify the object by shade using existing analog sensor, apply a theory to detect of the object information by using image data from CCD camera. It takes interest in the morphology of image, fuzzy inference and image analysis system on knowledge base. and now days, image processing method was used in the most part of field. So, in this paper proposed detecting method on specific position of specific object(fish) about real time gray level input image using image processing method(histogram analysis, binary, erosion, dilation, projection) and application case in intelligent processing system using the fuzzy inference algorithm and based on the computer with machine vision system. We obtained dynamic threshold value, contrast value, brightness value ,erosion and dilation value using fuzzy inference.\n\n\nThis processing system is inspected by IBM-PC interface digital I/O card, image grabber board, micro-controller and sensor, etc, so the operating data(the position of cutter, cutting operation, conveyor of movement, detecting fish, observation of sensor data, transmission of cutting data, etc) of processing system are monitoring and control on IBM-PC monitor during the processing time. \n\n\nA view of a component control machine in this paper, one frame image as captured by CCD camera of effective pixel resolution 320×240. If the positioning of the carriage is based on accurate gauging of the desired position, the image contains the necessary information.\n\n\nFinally, a control system processing work-cell was presented as a system to which the model could be applied. The results of a practical implementation of the system were given. We conformed that our study had better performance than conventional one.목차\n\n\nAbstract = i\n\n\n제1장 서론 = 1\n\n\n제2장 퍼지이론 = 3\n\n\n 2.1 보통집합과 퍼지집합 및 연산 = 3 \n\n\n 2.2 퍼지추론 = 7\n\n\n 2.3 퍼지 제어기의 구성 = 9\n\n\n제3장 비젼 시스템 및 영상처리 기법 = 13\n\n\n 3.1 비젼 시스템의 구성 = 13\n\n\n 3.2 영상처리 기법 = 15\n\n\n제4장 퍼지 추론을 이용한 영상인식 알고리즘 = 20\n\n\n 4.1 퍼지 추론에 의한 임계값 추출 = 20\n\n\n 4.2 퍼지 추론에 의한 명도값 및 대비값 추출 = 29\n\n\n 4.3 퍼지 추론에 의한 영상의 침식과 팽창연산 = 33\n\n\n제5장 제어모듈 구현 및 실험 = 38\n\n\n 5.1 영상획득 및 처리부 = 38\n\n\n 5.2 제어부 및 구동부 = 40\n\n\n 5.3 실험 및 결과 = 43\n\n\n제6장 결론 = 52\n\n\n참고문헌 = 53\n\n\n부록 = 5",

    "description": "The purpose of this paper is to study Sea Waybill, the new transport document replacing the traditional Bill of Lading in international trade.\n\n\nIn a word, Sea Waybill is considered as a type of shipping document by revolution of transport and communication.\n\n\nThe high speed of ship and delay of document delivery occurs in international Trade and is named by ‘The Crisis of Bill of Lading by Sea'. It results in the appearance, increase and use of Sea Waybill.\n\n\nAfter 1970, the use of Sea Waybill have been increased step by step. Sea Waybill was used at first in Europe. In North Atlantic line and Europe line, Sea Waybill use was 80% in 1996.\n\n\nHowever, Sea Waybill use of east Asian Line including Korea is sluggish at about 15%.\n\n\nWhat does make a difficulty in the use of Sea Waybill?\n\n\nIn the middle of various problems, the problem handling in this paper is concerned with the legislation of Sea Waybill.\n\n\nIn Korea, Any law about Sea Waybill is non-existed. So it is important to investigate this matter and find a lawful solution. This paper is composed of 5 chapters as followsChapterI introduces the purpose and scope of this research.\n\n\nChapterII reviews a general outline and kind of Bill of lading by Sea. It also shows the character of Sea Waybill and compares Sea Waybill and other transport document by Sea. \n\n\nChapterIII review the lawful situations of other countries and compare various conventions about Sea Waybill.\n\n\nChapterIV discuss the problems in using Sea Waybill on the commercial law and investigate the solutions of those problems.\n\n\nAs the conclusion, ChapterV summarizes the contents of each chapter and emphasizes the requirement of legislation relating to Sea Waybill.목차\n\n\nAbstract = v\n\n\n第1章 序論\n\n\n 第1節 硏究의 背景 및 目的 = 1\n\n\n 第2節 硏究의 範圍 및 方法 = 3\n\n\n第2章 船荷證券의 限界와 海上運送狀 導入의 必要性\n\n\n 第1節 海上運送證券의 種類 = 5\n\n\n  I. 船荷證券 = 5\n\n\n   1. 船荷證券의 意義와 種類 = 5\n\n\n   2. 船荷證券의 法的 性質 = 6\n\n\n  II. 複合運送證券 = 9\n\n\n   1. 複合運送證券의 意義와 種類 = 9\n\n\n   2. 複合運送證券의 法的 性質 = 15\n\n\n  III. 海上運送狀(Sea WayBill) = 16\n\n\n   1. 海上運送狀의 意義와 種類 = 16\n\n\n   2. 海上運送狀의 法的 性質 = 24\n\n\n 第2節 船荷證券의 限界와 海上運送狀의 利用效果 = 29\n\n\n  I. 船荷證券의 危機 = 29\n\n\n  II. 船荷證券의 危機에 대한 旣存의 對策과 限界 = 31\n\n\n   1. 船荷證券 原本 1통의 船長託送 = 31\n\n\n   2. 保證渡 = 32\n\n\n   3. 受荷人에 대한 船荷證券 直送 = 36\n\n\n   4. 船荷證券의 元地回收 = 37\n\n\n   5. 船荷證券의 目的地·第3地 發行(on line B/L) = 38\n\n\n   6. 電子式 船荷證券 = 39\n\n\n    (1) 電子式 船荷證券의 意義 = 39\n\n\n    (2) 電子式 船荷證券의 問題點 = 44\n\n\n   7. 스탠드바이 信用狀 = 46\n\n\n    (1) 스탠드바이 信用狀의 意義 = 46\n\n\n    (2) 스탠드바이 信用狀의 問題點 = 51\n\n\n  III. 海上運送狀 利用의 效果 = 54\n\n\n第3章 海上運送狀에 관한 比較法的 硏究\n\n\n 第1節 各國의 海上運送狀에 관한 立法動向 = 59\n\n\n  I. 英國 = 59\n\n\n  II. 美國 = 60\n\n\n 第2節 海上運送狀에 관한 國際運送規則과 國際協約 = 63\n\n\n  I. 헤이그規則(헤이그 비스비規則) = 63\n\n\n  II. 함부르크規則 = 64\n\n\n  III.

    "title": "Antidoto da língua portuguesa: edição e comentário",
    "description": "Mestrado em Estudos PortuguesesJosé de Macedo nasceu em Lisboa em 1667 e faleceu em 1717. Sabe-se pouco sobre a\r\nsua vida. Formou-se bacharel em Cânones, pela Universidade de Coimbra, esteve seis\r\nanos em Inglaterra. Publicou uma única obra, sob o pseudónimo de Antonio de Mello da\r\nFonseca, intitulada Antidoto da Lingua Portugueza. A obra não é datada, mas a dedicatória\r\nao Rei D. João V aponta para 1710. Desmontando, ao longo de mais de quatrocentas\r\npáginas, a metáfora que constitui o núcleo semântico do título da obra, Macedo desenvolve\r\na tese de que a língua portuguesa é passível de reformação e dessa reformação poderá\r\nsurgir uma língua nova, superior a todas as existentes e capaz de ascender a língua única\r\nno mundo. No seu tratado de reflexão marcadamente metalinguística, Camões assume um\r\npapel de relevo. A obra do poeta é apresentada como um sinal da excelência da língua\r\nportuguesa e o príncipe dos poetas como o utilizador mais sublime dessa língua, o\r\nemblema do património linguístico e literário da nação portuguesa.\r\nOs críticos que se ocuparam de Macedo não foram muito favoráveis às ideias apresentadas\r\ne desenvolvidas no que respeita à reforma da língua portuguesa, no entanto reconheceram\r\nque algo se podia aproveitar. Aquilo que na obra de Macedo tem despertado maior atenção\r\ndos críticos é o último e mais longo capítulo, dedicado a Camões.\r\nTrês séculos passados sobre a publicação da obra, a nossa perspectiva de leitura será,\r\ncom certeza, diferente. A obra adquiriu com o passar do tempo o estatuto de documento\r\nsobre a história da língua e da cultura portuguesas. Antidoto da Lingua Portugueza é um\r\ntexto muito rico em referências culturais, linguísticas, literárias e históricas, pelo que a sua\r\nanálise poderá contribuir para um conhecimento mais completo da cultura portuguesa na\r\ntransição do século XVII para o XVIII. Não pretendemos abarcar todas as perspectivas\r\npossíveis de análise que são inúmeras mas apenas revisitar o texto e, se possível, torná-lo\r\nmais acessível aos curiosos por estes assuntos da língua portuguesa.José de Macedo was born in Lisbon in 1667 and he died in 1717. Very few is known about\r\nhis life. He took the bachelor degree in Canons, at the University of Coimbra. He spent six\r\nyears in England. José Macedo only published one book under the pseudonym of António\r\nMello da Fonseca titled Antidoto da Lingua Portugueza. The novel is not dated, but the\r\ndedicatory to the king D. JoãoV refers to the year 1710 . Disassembling, along more than\r\nfour hundred pages, the metaphor which constitutes the semantic nucleus of the title of the\r\nnovel, Macedo develops the thesis that the portuguese language is susceptible of being\r\nreformatted and from this reformation a new language, superior to all those that exist and\r\nable of being unique in the world, can emerge. In this work of reflection remarkably\r\nmethalinguistic, Camões has an important role. The work of the poet is presented as a sign\r\nof excellence of portuguese language and the prince of the poets as the most sublime user\r\nof that language, the symbol of the linguistic and literary patrimony of the portuguese nation.\r\nThe critics who studied Macedo did not agree very much with the ideas related to the reform\r\nof the portuguese language presented and developed in Antidoto da Lingua Portugueza.\r\nHowever, they recognized that some aspects could be useful. What has caught the attention\r\nof the critics in Macedo’s work is the last and longest chapter, the chapter dedicated to\r\nCamões.\r\nThree centuries have passed since the publication of this work, and our reading perspective\r\nis, certainly, different. Over the years, the work acquired the status of document about the\r\nhistory of the portuguese language and culture. Antídoto da Língua Portuguesa, is a very\r\nrich text in cultural references. That is why its analysis can lead to a more complete\r\nunderstanding of the portuguese culture during the transition of the 17 th to the 18th century.\r\nIt is not our intention to study all possible perspectives of analyses; it is our intention just to\r\nrevisit the text and, if possible, to turn it more accessible to those who are interested in\r\nportuguese language issues.Il existe très peu de données bio-bibliographiques sur José de Macedo. Il est né à Lisbonne\r\nen 1667 (et mort en 1717) et a fréquenté l’Université de Coimbra. Les raisons que l’ont\r\nconduit à vivre en Angleterre pendant six ans sont méconnues. De José Macedo le plublic\r\nne connaît que Antidoto da Lingua Portugueza, oeuvre publiée sous le pseudonyme de\r\nAntónio Mello de Fonseca. La dédicace au roi D. João V porte la date de 1710. Tout au long\r\nde plus de quatre cents pages, l’auteur explicite la métaphore dont le titre est porteur.\r\nL´auteur défend que la langue portugaise peut subir des réformes et que celles-ci élèveront\r\nla langue à un niveau supérieur ce qui peut lui conférer un caractére d’unicité et de\r\nsuperiorité par rapport aux autres langues. Dans cette réflexion d’ordre essentiellement\r\nmétalinguistique, Camões prend une place fondamentale par l’exemple de son oeuvre\r\nconsidérée un signe d’excellence de la langue portugaise ; Camões s’avère la prince des\r\npoétes et le plus génial utilisateur de la langue, symbole du patrimoine linguistique et\r\nlittéraire de la nation portugaise.\r\nLes contemporains de Macedo et les critiques de son oeuvre ne partageaient pas ses idées\r\nen ce qui concerne les reformes présentées , développées et exemplifiées dans Antidoto da\r\nLingua Portugeza.

    "title": "New Men for New Women: Male Characters in American Women's Writing, 1794--1878",
    "description": "310 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1999.This dissertation examines representations of men and manhood in novels by five American women published between 1794 and 1878. It demonstrates that despite differences in form, setting, and artistic aim, these novels valorize similarly constituted male characters, the \"new men\" of my title. New men define themselves by affectionate family relationships and cooperative ties with friends and community, in contrast to the competitive, money-mad aristocrats they supplant. Together with the independent female characters that feminist critics have described in this fiction, new men make possible stable, nurturing families, which in turn are the foundation necessary for the success of the new Republic. I begin with two seduction novels, Susanna Rowson's Charlotte (1794) and Hannah Webster Foster's  The Coquette (1797), where new men are contrasted with European (and European style) aristocrats, and represent a preferable alternative for women as marriage partners and fathers. Next I turn to pioneering fiction by Catharine Sedgwick, including her first two novels, A New England Tale (1822) and Redwood (1824), and her later bestseller,  Home (1835). In Sedgwick the new men and the women with whom they are matched achieve an even greater balance in their relationships, owing to the expanded opportunities for female self-definition there. Chapter 3 examines new men in three novels by the best-selling writer E.D.E.N. Southworth:  Mark Sutherland (1854), Ishmael (1863--4), and The Hidden Hand (1859). Each of these characters is a Southern aristocrat by birth who comes to define himself in opposition to aristocratic norms via association with a marginalized group. Responding to criticism that conflates maleness with patriarchy and focuses on isolated male figures, Chapters 4,5, and 6 emphasize the preponderance and range of new men in Harriet Beecher Stowe's historical novels set in New England. In Stowe's idealized early Republic, fathers and grandfathers who respect independent women, invest themselves in the well-being of children, and privilege communal good over self-interest are the norm. In this setting younger generation males are approved as they resist the values represented by men of other cultures---sailors, urban and European-identified sophisticates, Southerners---in favor of old-time Republican values.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "title": "Words Into Flesh: Parisian Dance Theater, 1911--1924",
    "description": "256 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1997.The fourth chapter, \"Men in Tights,\" focuses on the performances of choreographer-dancers Vaslav Nijinsky and Jean Borlin to examine the construction of notions of gender through performance. I argue that dance theater of the 1910s and 1920s sought to identify itself as masculine, thus echoing post-war France's search for a new national identity, vital and virile. This new-found masculinization, however, was an uneasy one: in its attempts to erase the centuries-old interpretation of dance and music as weak and feminine, this new theater engaged in a hypermasculinity which was undone by the public's reading of the various performing bodies as homosexual. A concluding chapter, \"Relache,\" which takes its title from a 1924 work by the Ballets Suedois, continues this dissertation's focus on the work of the Swedish troupe, the Russians' artistic rivals in the Parisian avant-garde. I close on analyses of Relache, the Swedes' final ballet, to suggest that the work of performance itself lies in a game of present absences and absent presences.

    "title": "Pressing the Seed: Thoreau's Rhetorical Strategies",
    "description": "297 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1980.Thoreau has often been praised for his skillful shaping of sentences and correspondingly criticized for the discontinuity in his longer works. This study explores the question of pace in Thoreau's prose--how that pace is achieved and how it relates to our rhetorical expectations as readers. To analyze the shifting tones in Thoreau's writing, especially his more literary nature writing, I have singled out four common stances that he takes toward his material, depending on whether he emphasizes the story (a dramatic strategy), the storyteller (a narrative strategy), the setting or symbolic import of the story (a poetic strategy), or the moral of the story (an expository strategy).This study is divided into five chapters. The first discusses four early essays, &quot;The Landlord,&quot; &quot;Natural History of Massachusetts,&quot; &quot;A Walk to Wachusett,&quot; and &quot;A Winter Walk.&quot; In those essays the excursion emerges as a device for dramatic unity, and opposition (in theme, imagery, and point of view) as an identifiable rhetorical and stylistic habit. The basic strategy in &quot;The Landlord&quot; is poetic, centered on the imaginary character of the title and on the ironic imagery associated with his vocation. &quot;Natural History&quot; is a more experimental essay, with weak overall unity but with smaller sections unified by diverse methods--redefinition of terms, scientific catalogues, seasonal cycles, myth. In &quot;A Walk to Wachusett&quot; Thoreau's imaginative forays into the Concord countryside are formalized through the journey motif and the symbolic rendering of mountain-plain and day-night. &quot;A Winter Walk&quot; mutes the excursion motif, focusing instead on the opposing view of civilized man and natural man and upon Thoreau's change from literal indweller to spiritual indweller. With these last two essays Thoreau begins to combine dramatic, poetic, and narrative strategies into more unified patterns.The next two chapters examine the rhetorical strategies in A Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers. They identify a basic movement from the literal to the metaphorical to the expository, an inductive pattern firmly established in the book's early chapters, then abandoned in many later sections. The resulting discontinuity in these sections is only partially offset by minor unifying devices--personal mythology, catalogue rhetoric, and temporal-spatial perspective.Chapter Three describes Walden's more successful merging of rhetorical strategies. That book is able to concentrate in a single word or image or tone or action the collective emphasis of a whole chapter and of others beyond. The shifts in theme, time, and space are less rapid, more clearly marked, and more logical than in earlier works. Each chapter not only picks up the threads of the previous one but also establishes its own perspective, which develops by discernible patterns to a concluding comment or image.The last chapter studies three late essays, &quot;Walking,&quot; &quot;Autumnal Tints,&quot; and &quot;Wild Apples,&quot; where there is an increased complexity of the narrative strategy, an expansion of the catalogue as a structural device, and a concern for perception as both theme and technique.Rather than any clear linear development, the works studied here show a persistent struggle between the fragmentation of an encyclopedic form and the unifying force of certain recurrent and complex rhetorical strategies. Perhaps the lesson of Walden is that, given Thoreau's method of composition, continuity could be achieved only after years of exacting revision.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "title": "Comparison of Four Stimulus-Response Modalities in Paired-Associate Learning With Down's Syndrome Children",
    "description": "67 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1967.The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative effectiveness of four stimulus-response modalities (visual-motor, visual-vocal, auditory-motor, and auditory-vocal) in the learning of paired-associates by children diagnosed as having Down's Syndrome. These mentally retarded children have been found to perform better in visual-motor, rather than auditory-vocal, tasks of cognitive ability.Four lists of eight pairs each were developed, using 32 common objects as first members and eight parts of the body as second members of the pairs. Twenty-four children with Down's Syndrome from day school classes for the trainable mentally retarded were given the task in the four stimulus-response (S-R) modalities thus having each S serve as his own control. Pre-training insured Ss ability to perform the responses. The order of lists and of stimulus-response modalities were counter-balanced. The learning criterion was two consecutive correct anticipations of the pairs, or ten trials, whichever came first, with the Gillette drop-out procedure used on learned pairs.Mean error scores for the four S-R modalities were visual-motor, 21; visual-vocal, 24; auditory-motor, 20; and auditory-vocal, 42. A 4 x 24 factorial analysis of variance of the error scores demonstrated a significant main effect of S-R modality (F = 20.82, p &amp;lt; .001). By the Scheffe method of multiple comparisons, the auditory-vocal modality was found to have been the most difficult; the other S-R modalities were not significantly different from each other. Neither stimulus modality nor response modality alone had a significant effect on learning.This sample of Down's Syndrome children experienced great difficulty in associating pairs of spoken words in the auditory-vocal modality. This result was explained in terms of an analysis of the paired-associate task into two phases, the acquisition phase and the recall phase. In the acquisition phase, there are two stimuli and one response: in S and R modality terms, S-S-R. In the recall phase, there is one stimulus and one response: S-R. When  both stimuli were words, these Ss experienced great difficulty in associating pairs. Three aspects of words as stimuli may be related to the difficulty in association: words are auditory, symbolic, and similar to each other.The results suggest four questions for research: (1) To what extent is this finding generalizable to a wider population of children? (2) Is the difficulty in associating pairs of words due to the degree of symbolism, to the auditory nature, or to the similarity? (3) Is the difficulty due to the combination of two words and a vocal response? (4) Is the difficulty traceable to experience, or is it a basic characteristic of Down's Syndrome children?**Originally published in DAI Vol. 28, No. 12.

    "description": "122 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1988.Continuing professional education has grown to become a prominent segment of adult education in the United States. Providers of continuing professional education are faced with the challenge of exploring ways to more effectively communicate program information by brochures or other vehicles to prospective participants. This study explored several questions surrounding this topic.The research effort was divided into two studies, with Study I seeking to identify which program information items were of most importance to the prospective participant. Survey methodology was utilized for data collection. A Course Information Respondent Form was developed and distributed to a random sample of 456 hospital administrators.The data were analyzed to identify mean values of each item for purposes of ranking. The data were also subjected to a factor analysis, Pearson Correlation, ANOVA, and Chi Square. The results indicated the program information items of greatest importance to prospective program participants were &quot;general course content (purpose),&quot; &quot;specific course content (objectives),&quot; and &quot;relevance of content to work situations&quot;. Differential relationships between characteristics of respondents and type of program information were identified and discussed.Based on the findings obtained in Study I, it was clear that much of the salient information about a program could be provided in the title of the program. Also, the first encounter most professionals have with program content is by means of the program/course title as communicated in direct mail pieces or advertisements in periodicals. Study II attempted, therefore, to ascertain what form, ranging on a continuum from practical to theoretical, a program/brochure title should assume to appeal to the education preferences of healthcare administrators.The collection of data was accomplished by using techniques of survey methodology. A survey entitled the &quot;Program Title Preference Scale&quot; (PTPS) was developed. The PTPS was distributed to a sample of 850 practicing healthcare administrators. The results suggested prospective program participants (healthcare administrators) found program titles with a &quot;practical&quot; content emphasis most appealing. Program titles with a theoretical content emphasis were ranked as least appealing. Differential relationships between characteristics of respondents and program titles were identified and discussed.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "title": "Communication Between an Early Childhood Program and the Families It Serves",
    "description": "345 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.The exchange of information and other resources through communication activity is a key component of the relationships between families with young children and the staff of programs that serve them. The communication practices of staff members and family members are seldom the focus of research, although the substantial body of professional literature on communicating effectively with families suggests that interest in such practices may be high. This study of program-family communication at one Midwestern school district's \"model\" early childhood employed qualitative methods to: (a) discern trends related to official and informal communication practices at the site, (b) examine consistency between those practices and the program's stated vision and goals, and (c) investigate the possible impact of global, national, state, local, and program-level contexts on the interactions among families and staff in the program. Research methods used in this study included observation at the program site and in the community, interviews with staff and family members, surveys of program personnel and family members, and analysis of documents generated by the staff. Several trends in communication activity were identified regarding the methods of communication, the content of communication, the uses and complementary nature of official and \"person-to-person\" communication, and the types of challenges staff and families encountered in their efforts to communicate with each other. Consistency was noted between the communication policies and practices of the staff and some aspects of the program's vision statement and school improvement plan related to program-family interactions. Contemporary patterns of migration into the U.S. were among the contextual conditions found to influence communication activity in the program; a relatively high percentage of the program's target population had home languages other than English. Another contextual factor was local school district support for early childhood programming. Recommendations for the program include continuing those communication activities that personnel and family members seem to consider favorably. Recommendations for policy-makers include critical re-examination of assumptions underlying Title 1 policies regarding \"parent involvement\" in children's education. Suggestions for further research include creation of interdisciplinary research agendas regarding communication between families with young children and the programs that serve them.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "description": "267 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1985.Women were actively involved in the Civil War abolition movement. Intellectuals such as Julia Ward Howe and Lydia Maria Child used their writing skills to encourage public support for antislavery. Harriet Beecher Stowe, the &quot;little lady&quot; who allegedly caused the big war, took advantage of her enormous popularity in England to urge British support for the Union. A young Philadelphia teenager named Anna Dickinson rose to prominence as an abolition orator, earning the title &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; of the Civil War.When Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation went into effect on January 1, 1863, many Americans considered the antislavery struggle to be over. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony disagreed. These two veterans of the antebellum abolition and woman's rights movements founded the National Woman's Loyal League. Their goal was a massive petition drive demanding immediate Congressional action to end slavery in all states. With headquarters in New York, the organization quickly spread to all the northern states.Women abolitionists played an important role in the final push for Congressional action on the emancipation issue. They were actively involved in the presidential campaign of 1864 as well. Finally, their Civil War abolition work had long term consequences for late nineteenth century feminism.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "title": "Jean-Michel Basquiat's Language",
    "description": "239 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.Previous analyses of the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960--88) tend to focus on decoding these drawings and paintings, while almost completely ignoring those elements that cannot be tied to a specific (and static) iconography or historical lineage of influence. Yet, the iconographic isolation of specific symbols and icons considers neither how the visal and verbal signs within these works constitute meaning nor what they may reveal about Basquiat's own artistic concerns. For this body of work, it is not enough to decode signs and symbols; we must also try to discern meaning in their interactions and in the artist's protocols of construction. Following the title of this dissertation, I approach Basquiat's work as a complete (and partially unknown) language that must be considered on its own terms.My methods rely on similar examples in the studies of music and literature, specifically those of bebop improvisation and Beat writing, which have already moved beyond simple description to consider the formulation of meaning. As Basquiat was also a musician and a writer, the connections of these disciplines to his own visual practice are significant. In theories of musical improvisation the emphasis lies not in locating the origin of particular musical notes; instead, scholars focus on the combinations of those notes in different performative contexts and find meaning in the organization of appropriated material. In Beat literature the methods of text-collage highlight the flexibility of language, and create entirely new narratives through a blend of borrowed ones. Most importantly, the focus of these studies in music and literature is not necessarily analyzing every note or letter in isolation; instead, the dominant theories of bebop improvisation and Beat literature look into the patterns created by the combinations of these singular elements. In a similar vein, I do not focus exclusively on iconography or on decoding every element of Basquiat's paintings and drawings throughout this dissertation. Rather, I attempt to find meaningful patterns within specific works that speak to the artist's processes of composition.In the second chapter I consider the implications of reading race into Jean-Michel Basquiat's production; Basquiat's blackness is an issue not only in the scholarship surrounding these works, but is in the works themselves. The third chapter seeks to describe parallels between the working protocols in Basquiat's compositional methods in painting and drawing to those of jazz. The final chapter examines Basquiat's connections to the literary strategies of the &quot;Beat&quot; writers, principally Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, who provided models of spontaneity and collage, and who negotiated identity in ways that Basquiat could not have found exclusively in his visual sources. Throughout this dissertation I argue that Basquiat's works are &quot;multivocal&quot; and operate on multiple levels of reference and perception; therefore, the words or images on the surfaces do not represent only one specific concept. They generate a multiplicity of ideas.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "title": "Analysis of trends in demand for computer literacy for librarians in academic and public libraries from 1974 to 1989",
    "description": "Computer applications have changed in many aspects the ways by which libraries provide their services. As a result, computer literacy has gradually become an important competency for librarians in many positions. This study investigates the market change regarding the demand for computer literacy for librarians in academic and public libraries from 1974 to 1989. The main focus of the study includes: (1) trace the growth and changes over time in the demand for computer literate librarians in different position types; and (2) identify the basic elements for qualifying librarians of different positions to be functionally computer literate and the changes of such elements over time.The study collects data from 3,125 job advertisements published in American Libraries in 1974, 1979, 1984, and 1989 for full-time professional librarian positions in academic and public libraries. Among them, 2,091 were from academic libraries, and 1,034 from public libraries. Content analysis is applied to each advertisement to determine whether or not the position demanded computer-related competencies, and if so, what particular competencies were specified. Information on library type, position type, job title, institution name, etc. was also gathered from the advertisements while the data about size of library were collected from the American Library Directory. The data were analyzed and tested against a set of proposed hypotheses.The study revealed that the demand for computer literate librarians increased substantially during the period studied, but the increase was more dramatic in academic libraries than in public libraries. It was also found that although significant increases in such demand were generally observed in most position types, the degree of the increase varied greatly among types of positions. One of the trends identified was a gradual shift of focus in computer applications from technical services functions to public services functions. Other major findings include that library size is in general a poor indicator of the need for computer literate librarians, and the demand for computer literacy for managerial positions and non-managerial positions tends to be comparable within the same position type. With regard to the components of computer literacy for librarians, the study indicated that despite the fact that there was a cluster of basic computer-related knowledge and skills that were frequently requested by various library positions, the core components of computer literacy tend to vary in different types of positions.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio",

    "title": "Consumer Symbolicum: The Advertising Legacy of Pierre Martineau (Social Research, Marketing)",
    "description": "219 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1985.Martineau's contributions can be grouped into two major areas of historical importance: First, he devoted his professional life to legitimizing qualitative research (currently known as social research, or &quot;VALS,&quot; i.e.--Values and Lifestyles research) in advertising. In 1953, after nearly twenty years in editorial writing and retail advertising management at the Memphis Press Scimitar, he was appointed research director at the Chicago Tribune. Throughout his career, Martineau was a prolific author. In 1957 he published Motivation In Advertising; up until his death in 1964, he was a regular contributor of scholarly papers to prestigous academic journals. Moreover, during his decade of leadership at the Tribune, he was constantly in demand as the keynote speaker at dozens of conferences and seminars where he urged advertisers and marketers to do more qualitative research instead of relying solely on tradtional &quot;nose-counting&quot; techniques. Martineau's first significant change was to realign the priorities of the Tribune's research department. Instead of relying exclusively on empirical methods, his policies evolved toward a more humanistic research philosophy combining a number of social research methods with traditional survey techniques. Second, Martineau did far more than help popularize social research in the Fifties--he contributed to advertising's communication theory and the understanding of symbolic language. Most of Motivation In Advertising is devoted to a discussion of the power of symbolic forms as carriers of meaning. Until Martineau, no other advertising practitioner or scholar had studied the philosophies of Ernst Cassier and Susanne Langer, interpreted them in the context of advertising communication theory, and published these findings. Hence the title, CONSUMER SYMBOLICUM: Martineau's ideas about symbolic language as human communication were embodied in most of his writings. This was his most important contribution to advertising literature and forms the capstone for this dissertation.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "description": "This thesis is an attempt to provide a balanced account of the history of the one-room country school experience in the states of the Middle West prior to 1918. It begins with an attempt to discover how the people of Midwest farming neighborhoods viewed the world around them and the place of formal education therein. In particular, the rural traditions of pietism, localism, and pastoralism are examined as major components of agrarian ideology. Each in a significant way suggests that rural people often believed there were limitations to the benefits of common schools.Additionally, the thesis provides a basis for understanding the political economy of Midwest agrarian society. The prerequisites for acquiring title to a farm and maintaining a successful farming operation are discussed in detail, along with the impact of these factors on rural schools and rural school attendance. The thesis argues that in order to make sense of the country school experience one must understand the interplay of agrarian ideology and political economy.Research in six different Midwestern states at state and local archives yielded most of the data for the last three chapters and conclusion of the thesis. The record of learners, teachers, and school board men in the rural Midwest demonstrates that rural resistance to state-level centralization and educational reform was not grounded, as some have claimed, in sentimental allegiance to local democracy. Rather, this resistance was the logical result of agrarian views of the world and the circumstances required to own land, cultivate it, and pass it on to the next generation.Special emphasis is reserved for the rural reception of the educational initiatives of Theodore Roosevelt's Commission on Country Life. Data provided in this thesis demonstrates that the Country Life movement was not a plot to impose an urban model on rural schools, as some historians have suggested.

    "description": "112 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2004.This dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay is titled \"The Political Business Cycle, National Election and Currency Crisis.\" Previous studies concentrated only on economic variables and did not pay much attention to institutional or political variables as possible indicators of currency crisis. After controlling economic variables which were argued to have a close relationship with currency crisis in the past studies, I found that the national election had a significant impact on the currency crisis. \"The Recovery Process from Currency Crisis\" is the title of the second essay. I examined the movement of several economic variables after the currency crisis and tried to find a general recovery pattern. I found that the combination of expansionary fiscal policy and austere monetary policy is the best policy mix for the recovery process. It turned out that the crisis had no negative impact on the long-term growth trend and the consumption smoothing theory held in the long-run. The third essay is titled \"The Initiation of Economic Reform: the Cases of Public Enterprise Reform and Trade Liberalization.\" This part tried to find under what conditions governments initiate and maintain market-oriented reforms, focusing particularly on the public enterprise reform and trade liberalization. By using mainly the \"Country Profile\" and \"Country Report\" from the Economist Intelligence Unit, we constructed the initiation of public enterprise reform and trade liberalization data for each country from 1970 to 1999. We found that crisis hypothesis and honeymoon period hypothesis are strongly supported by the data. Quite interestingly, the data suggest that a democratic government is more likely to initiate economic reform. Also, we found that seeking for new financial sources to deal with budget deficit is an important motive for PE reform and that a favorable balance of payment position is an important prerequisite for the initiation of trade liberalization.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "title": "Pressing the Seed: Thoreau's Rhetorical Strategies",
    "description": "297 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1980.Thoreau has often been praised for his skillful shaping of sentences and correspondingly criticized for the discontinuity in his longer works. This study explores the question of pace in Thoreau's prose--how that pace is achieved and how it relates to our rhetorical expectations as readers. To analyze the shifting tones in Thoreau's writing, especially his more literary nature writing, I have singled out four common stances that he takes toward his material, depending on whether he emphasizes the story (a dramatic strategy), the storyteller (a narrative strategy), the setting or symbolic import of the story (a poetic strategy), or the moral of the story (an expository strategy).This study is divided into five chapters. The first discusses four early essays, &quot;The Landlord,&quot; &quot;Natural History of Massachusetts,&quot; &quot;A Walk to Wachusett,&quot; and &quot;A Winter Walk.&quot; In those essays the excursion emerges as a device for dramatic unity, and opposition (in theme, imagery, and point of view) as an identifiable rhetorical and stylistic habit. The basic strategy in &quot;The Landlord&quot; is poetic, centered on the imaginary character of the title and on the ironic imagery associated with his vocation. &quot;Natural History&quot; is a more experimental essay, with weak overall unity but with smaller sections unified by diverse methods--redefinition of terms, scientific catalogues, seasonal cycles, myth. In &quot;A Walk to Wachusett&quot; Thoreau's imaginative forays into the Concord countryside are formalized through the journey motif and the symbolic rendering of mountain-plain and day-night. &quot;A Winter Walk&quot; mutes the excursion motif, focusing instead on the opposing view of civilized man and natural man and upon Thoreau's change from literal indweller to spiritual indweller. With these last two essays Thoreau begins to combine dramatic, poetic, and narrative strategies into more unified patterns.The next two chapters examine the rhetorical strategies in A Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers. They identify a basic movement from the literal to the metaphorical to the expository, an inductive pattern firmly established in the book's early chapters, then abandoned in many later sections. The resulting discontinuity in these sections is only partially offset by minor unifying devices--personal mythology, catalogue rhetoric, and temporal-spatial perspective.Chapter Three describes Walden's more successful merging of rhetorical strategies. That book is able to concentrate in a single word or image or tone or action the collective emphasis of a whole chapter and of others beyond. The shifts in theme, time, and space are less rapid, more clearly marked, and more logical than in earlier works. Each chapter not only picks up the threads of the previous one but also establishes its own perspective, which develops by discernible patterns to a concluding comment or image.The last chapter studies three late essays, &quot;Walking,&quot; &quot;Autumnal Tints,&quot; and &quot;Wild Apples,&quot; where there is an increased complexity of the narrative strategy, an expansion of the catalogue as a structural device, and a concern for perception as both theme and technique.Rather than any clear linear development, the works studied here show a persistent struggle between the fragmentation of an encyclopedic form and the unifying force of certain recurrent and complex rhetorical strategies. Perhaps the lesson of Walden is that, given Thoreau's method of composition, continuity could be achieved only after years of exacting revision.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "description": "267 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1985.Women were actively involved in the Civil War abolition movement. Intellectuals such as Julia Ward Howe and Lydia Maria Child used their writing skills to encourage public support for antislavery. Harriet Beecher Stowe, the &quot;little lady&quot; who allegedly caused the big war, took advantage of her enormous popularity in England to urge British support for the Union. A young Philadelphia teenager named Anna Dickinson rose to prominence as an abolition orator, earning the title &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; of the Civil War.When Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation went into effect on January 1, 1863, many Americans considered the antislavery struggle to be over. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony disagreed. These two veterans of the antebellum abolition and woman's rights movements founded the National Woman's Loyal League. Their goal was a massive petition drive demanding immediate Congressional action to end slavery in all states. With headquarters in New York, the organization quickly spread to all the northern states.Women abolitionists played an important role in the final push for Congressional action on the emancipation issue. They were actively involved in the presidential campaign of 1864 as well. Finally, their Civil War abolition work had long term consequences for late nineteenth century feminism.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "description": "250 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1987.Based on the principle of citizen participation, the theory of cultural pluralism, and the concept of service partnership, this study focused on the Asian American elderly in a large midwestern city to examine the problems related to the development, delivery, and utilization of the services sponsored by the Title III of the Older Americans Act.Data for this study were collected from four sources:  (1) the 1980 census relative to the economic and social conditions of Asian American elderly, (2) mailed questionnaires to 62 agency directors, (3) interviews with 11 Asian American professional staff and four board members, and (4) interviews with 18 Asian American elderly clients.The 1980 census data illustrate that the Asian American elderly, as a group, are in better socioeconomic condition than other minority groups. However, the census data also reveal that a significant number of Asian American elderly either do not have any income or only have marginal income. The findings of the primary data shows that there are six major variables attracting Asian American elderly clients to OAA services. Among them are:  (1) the location of the agency in or near an Asian community, (2) Asian staff and board representation, (3) outreach activities conducted in Asian languages, (4) bicultural staff who have knowledge on Asian American elderly's special needs and values, 5) bilingual staff, and (6) the ability of agency programs to meet the unique needs of the target population.This study suggests that, based on the principle of citizen participation, the Older Americans Act service delivery system should include Asian Americans as agency board members, professional staff members, and indigenous service providers. This study also recommends the Administration on Aging, state units on aging, and area agencies on aging to expand the scope and scale of funding the indigenous Asian social agencies, and to encourage social agencies to have more Asian American board and staff members.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "title": "New Men for New Women: Male Characters in American Women's Writing, 1794--1878",
    "description": "310 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1999.This dissertation examines representations of men and manhood in novels by five American women published between 1794 and 1878. It demonstrates that despite differences in form, setting, and artistic aim, these novels valorize similarly constituted male characters, the \"new men\" of my title. New men define themselves by affectionate family relationships and cooperative ties with friends and community, in contrast to the competitive, money-mad aristocrats they supplant. Together with the independent female characters that feminist critics have described in this fiction, new men make possible stable, nurturing families, which in turn are the foundation necessary for the success of the new Republic. I begin with two seduction novels, Susanna Rowson's Charlotte (1794) and Hannah Webster Foster's  The Coquette (1797), where new men are contrasted with European (and European style) aristocrats, and represent a preferable alternative for women as marriage partners and fathers. Next I turn to pioneering fiction by Catharine Sedgwick, including her first two novels, A New England Tale (1822) and Redwood (1824), and her later bestseller,  Home (1835). In Sedgwick the new men and the women with whom they are matched achieve an even greater balance in their relationships, owing to the expanded opportunities for female self-definition there. Chapter 3 examines new men in three novels by the best-selling writer E.D.E.N. Southworth:  Mark Sutherland (1854), Ishmael (1863--4), and The Hidden Hand (1859). Each of these characters is a Southern aristocrat by birth who comes to define himself in opposition to aristocratic norms via association with a marginalized group. Responding to criticism that conflates maleness with patriarchy and focuses on isolated male figures, Chapters 4,5, and 6 emphasize the preponderance and range of new men in Harriet Beecher Stowe's historical novels set in New England. In Stowe's idealized early Republic, fathers and grandfathers who respect independent women, invest themselves in the well-being of children, and privilege communal good over self-interest are the norm. In this setting younger generation males are approved as they resist the values represented by men of other cultures---sailors, urban and European-identified sophisticates, Southerners---in favor of old-time Republican values.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

All current gardeners were satisfied with the program but were concerned about the complexity of the Master Gardener Handbook, lack of hands-on training, minimal training on how to use the educational resources, and constraints placed on the volunteer activities. The benefits perceived by the Master Gardeners included the learning acquired and the camaraderie among the gardeners. The majority of the Master Gardeners supported a recertification program and a continued volunteer commitment. Staff members were concerned about liability issues and the continued use of the Master Gardener title when volunteers became inactive.

    "title": "The Dissemination of Information on Title Ix, Sex Equity Legislation, to Teachers",
    "description": "367 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1981.The purpose of this thesis has been to reconstruct and analyze the process of the dissemination of information on Title IX, the sex equity provision of the 1972 Education Amendments, to teachers in Minnesota. The study focused on describing that process, determining what conditions (political constraints, financial resources, etc.) have affected the process, and assessing the effectiveness of the dissemination process with respect to teacher awareness of the basic requirements of the Title IX law.Three hypotheses were tested:  (1) teachers in a district where there has been high personal contact in the dissemination process would have a higher awareness of Title IX requirements than teachers in a district where such contact had not occurred, (2) teachers in a district that employed a Title IX Coordinator with no responsibilities other than Title IX would have a higher awareness of Title IX requirements than teachers in a district that did not have such a Title IX Coordinator position, and (3) teachers with a more pro-feminist attitude toward the roles of women in society would have a higher awareness of Title IX requirements than teachers with a more traditional attitude toward the roles of women in society.In order to answer the research questions and test hypotheses, interviews were conducted at the Minnesota State Department of Education in St. Paul, the Great Lakes Regional Sex Desegregation Center in Indianapolis, Indiana, and at three local Education Agencies in the Twin Cities Metropolitan area. A survey instrument was designed and field-tested to assess teacher awareness of the basic requirements of Title IX. An attitude scale developed and validated by Spence and Helmreich (1972) was incorporated in the survey to assess teacher attitudes toward sex equity. Finally, the survey requested teachers to indicate their sources of information on Title IX.The study concludes that heavy reliance on either personal contact, ormore impersonal contacts (printed communications), is not sufficient to inform teachers of all of the major requirements of the law. The thesis suggests that combining communication channels may be a more effective way of communicating all of the basic requirements of the law.Further, it was indicated that having a Title IX Coordinator with no responsibilities other than Title IX does not necessarily create a higher awareness of Title IX requirements among teachers. However, the data also suggested that local administrators and teachers have considered such a position to be extremely valuable for expenditures and thorough implementation of the law. The study suggests that further research is needed on the value of the Title IX Coordinator position and the most effective way to assign Title IX responsibilities.The study also found that teachers with a more pro-feminist attitude had a significantly higher awareness of Title IX requirements. The data further indicated that female teachers had a significantly higher awareness of Title IX requirements, female teachers had a significantly more pro-feminist attitude, and younger teachers (under 40) had a significantly more pro-feminist attitude.The thesis suggests that the dissemination of information on Title IX to teachers is an important part of the implementation of the law. Further, the study indicated that local administrator support and commitment to Title IX is crucial to successful implementation. More highly committed administrators provide the amount and type of information to teachers which is needed to make changes. The thesis concludes that teachers must be aware of and understand the requirements and implications of Title IX, and how to implement Title IX, in order for the law to be successful in its goals.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

Due to the lack of knowledge of available scores, this ensemble has been neglected in performance halls. The trio for flute, oboe, and clarinet serves as a variance to the standard woodwind quintet program, or as an ensemble work for solo recitals. In addition, there are compositions available for performance by young students through professionals.Forty-six compositions written specifically for flute, oboe and clarinet are included in this annotated bibliography. Works that have been arranged for woodwind trio are listed in an Appendix located at the end of the document. In addition only works that are available for public purchase in the form of scores and/or individual parts are included in the annotations.Annotations of the works are presented in two sections: factual information and analytical information. Factual information includes: composer's name, place and date of birth and death, occupation, dedication or commission, title of the composition, location and name of publisher, date of composition or publication, movement titles and/or tempo indications, duration in minutes, form of distribution (score and parts, parts alone, score alone), range for each instrument, and level of difficulty. After these listings, the first bars of the score, or individual parts are included. Analytical information includes performance considerations, and descriptions of musical parameters: texture, rhythm and meter, pitch organization, and form. In addition, the author's opinion regarding the works suitability for performance or study is provided.The analyses of the works is intended to be performance rather than theoretically oriented. Comments for each of the three instruments is provided, but more concentration is given to the flute since it is the writers area of expertise. The writer consulted extensively with accomplished oboe and clarinet performers so that the comments directed to these instruments are sound.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "title": "Wolfish Festivity: The Humor of American Frontier Literature",
    "description": "294 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1987.This study attempts to revise the established way of discussing American frontier humor by arguing that its nature is a dynamic exchange between renewal and degradation or festive and wolfish expression. The festive tradition offers readers the vicarious pleasure of wanton &quot;misrule&quot; (also called saturnalian revelry or carnival freedom). The &quot;wolfish&quot; reference in the title derives from the work of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), in which man is an enemy of every man, and the state of nature is lawless and cruel.The conventional view that the frontier is exclusively American is broadened to emphasize American interplay with the European literary tradition (the &quot;festive&quot; in Shakespeare and the &quot;carnivalesque&quot; theories of Mikhail Bakhtin). This interplay shapes a two-sided humor that is festive and wolfish. I define frontier humor as theatrical story-telling which counters civilized restraint with the festive fun of the body, and delights in exposing the wolfish side of white civilization--a vitality mixed with revelry and contempt, a joyous and a dark side.Chapter One defines terms to be used in this study of frontier humor. Chapter Two analyzes the evolution of wolfish festivity in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century America. Its literary depiction begins with William Bradford's history of the decline of Puritan community, especially the sections recording the activity of confidence man and a festive rebellion. Hawthorne's &quot;The May-Pole of Merrymount&quot; treats the festive rebellion as a paradigmatic conflict between pagan jollity and Christian gloom. Mary Rowlandson's Indian captivity narrative shows Wilderness opposing civilization, with Indians as demonic and savage. The works of James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving introduce the frontier humor of wild and degenerate types.Chapter Three analyzes the Southwestern humor circulated nationally in Spirit of the Times. Southwestern humor virtually parodies the festive and wolfish humor of Irving and Cooper. The remaining chapters analyze later inversions of Southwestern humor. Chapter Four examines Mark Twain's major frontier works. Chapter Five compares the frontier humor writtern by Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, and Herman Melville.

    "description": "68 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1987.Let K be a number of field with ring of integers o, and let G be a fixed finite group. If K$\\sb\\pi$ is a tame Galois G-extension, the integral closure ${\\cal O}\\sb\\pi$ of o in K$\\sb\\pi$ is a locally free rank one oG-module, so realizes a class cl(${\\cal O}\\sb\\pi$) in the locally free class group Cl(oG). We let R(oG) denote the set of classes so realized. In the case where G is an elementary abelian group, we obtain the following result.Theorem. Let K be a number field with ring of integers o, and G an elementary abelian group. Let c $\\in$ R(oG), and denote by N(c,X) the number of tame Galois G-extensions K$\\sb\\pi$ for which cl(${\\cal O}\\sb\\pi$) = c and having absolute discriminant ${\\rm d}({\\cal O}\\sb\\pi/\\doubz) \\le {\\rm X}.$ Then N(c,X) $\\sim\\beta$ $\\cdot$ Y(log Y)$\\sp{\\rm r-1}$ where Y$\\sp{\\varphi(\\vert{\\rm G}\\vert)}$ $\\cdot$ d(o/$\\doubz$)$\\sp{\\vert{\\rm G}\\vert}$ = X. Here, $\\beta$ is a positive constant depending on K and G, but not on the class c $\\in$ R(oG), and r is a positive integer which depends only on K and G.This is proved in Theorem (4.1). It tells us that the number of tame Galois G-extensions K$\\sb\\pi$ for which d(${\\cal O}\\sb\\pi/\\doubz) \\le$ X and cl(${\\cal O}\\sb\\pi$) = c $\\in$ R(oG) is asymptotically the same for each c $\\in$ R(oG). This is the equal distribution result of the title.A result for fields is retrieved by noting that, for a tame Galois field extension L/K with Gal(L/K) = $\\Gamma$ isomorphic to G, a choice of isomorphism $\\Gamma \\cong {\\rm G}$ makes L into a G-extension.

    "title": "Efforts on the Part of Hospital Personnel to Learn About and Cope With Diagnostic Related Groups (Drgs)",
    "description": "161 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1986.In April 1983, the Social Security Amendments Act of 1983 (Public Law 98-21) was signed into law by the President. Title VI of this law contained the prospective payment system based on diagnostic related groups (DRGs).The necessity to understand and cope with changing circumstances constitutes a powerful motivating force for learning. Under such circumstances adaptation through assimilation or accommodation is a pressing issue for the affected. This study examined aspects of the relationship between the introduction of DRGs and coping with this change on the part of hospital personnel which typically included one or more types of related learning activities.Throughout, the study utilized an exploratory naturalistic inquiry approach. In the first phase of the study, data was collected through interviewing; in the second phase, through the use of a nation-wide mailed questionnaire. This exploratory study was set up to ask what was the simple correlation between two frequency distributions on a two to four point scale and to report the level of significance of the association given in numbers involved in each of the distribution arrays.It was found that in some hospital settings and for some hospital employees, the implementation of DRGs can be handled through assimilation. They can learn to understand and cope with DRGs largely through any of the forms of reception learning, including reading, hearing and observing. For them, adapting to DRGs is learning to make minor adjustments in the way they were trained to view their work and do it. In other settings and for other hospital employees, the implementation of DRGs can, in contrast, call for accommodating how they view their work and go about doing it. For them, learning to adapt to DRGs may well call for autonomous learning when necessary; guided inquiry when possible.Findings of the study can be a contribution to both theoreticians and practitioners who find themselves in similar change situations. The study's findings are likely to help them understand the nature of facilitating and limiting factors in learning to understand and cope with change when adapting may require accommodation.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "title": "Sexual harassment: Education and the law",
    "description": "Shortly after sexual harassment was recognized by the courts as a violation of Title VII's ban on sex discrimination in the workplace, it was also acknowledged as a violation of Title IX, which seeks to eliminate sex discrimination in education. Over time, an increasingly wide range of conduct has been recognized as \"sexual harassment\"; the class of persons thought capable of perpetrating and suffering this abuse has expanded as well. Early in the concept's history one could claim intelligibly that sexual harassment occurred when a teacher overtly blocked a student's educational aims, based on the student's sex. Now, sexual harassment is conceived to include verbal and symbolic expression that creates a \"hostile school environment\"; and students, as well as teachers, are thought capable of creating such an environment.The legal status of sexual harassment has influenced the way in which educational institutions and academicians have framed the problem of sexual harassment and shaped perceptions about how it can best be addressed. Schools receiving federal funds are required to develop policies forbidding sexual harassment and grievance procedures for reporting policy violations. However desirable such policies and procedures may be, they do not cover all the educational concerns at stake regarding the problem of sexual harassment. The more inclusively sexual harassment is conceived, the less adequate are existing measures intended to redress the problem.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio",

    "title": "Is the ubiquitous presence of barium carbonate responsible for the poor aqueous processing ability of barium titanate?",
    "description": "The ubiquitous presence of barium carbonate (BaCO3 - BC) as an impurity in barium titanate (BaTiO3 - BT) has been pointed out as the main reason for the well-known difficulties found by many investigators when attempting to process BT powders in aqueous media. Different and controversial arguments have been put forward to justify the observed aqueous processing difficulties of BT, but a satisfactory explanation is still to be found. With this aim, a systematic study was here undertaken to shed further light on the solid/liquid interactions occurring at the surface of BC and BT particles and their impact on the dispersion ability of both powders, separately and mixed in certain proportions. Long term colloidal stability and high solid loadings (60 vol.%) were obtained for BC, while colloidal instability and a lower maximum content of solids (50 vol.%) could be achieved for BT. This responds to the question risen in the title. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd, All rights reserved",

    "title": "Inspiration For And Interpretation Of The Vocal Writing For The Title Character In George Enescu's Opera Oedipe",
    "description": "The titular role of George Enescu’s opera, Oedipe, is one of the most challenging bass-baritone roles in the literature. With a vast scope and a rare level of notational specificity, the part ranges from Wagnerian lyricism to tragedian declamation. In addition to quartertones, the part also calls for numerous extended techniques and timbral effects. In 1909, Enescu saw the great tragedian actor, Jean Mounet-Sully, give an arresting performance of Jules La Croix’s adaptation of Oedipe-roi by Sophocles. An examination of Mounet-Sully’s wide range and variety of extended vocal techniques as evidence on the 1900 record of his performance of Oedipe-roi shows how his unusually virtuosic voice and declamatory style inspired Enescu to write Oedipe. By analyzing the actor’s performance with the computer application VoceVista, it is possible to see how he used classical vocal technique in his declamation. This information can help a singer prepare Enescu’s music effectively, authentically, and without compromising vocal technique or clarity of diction. It will also offer insights into ways to successfully perform extended vocal techniques found in other twentieth- and twenty-first-century operas.U of I OnlyUIUC School of Music polic",

    "title": "Land tenure security and resource use in Peruvian Amazonia: A case study of the Ucayali region",
    "description": "The assignment of private property rights has been praised as one effective policy option to assure that resources are put into their most valued use by ensuring economic agents that the rewards for their work will be in their hands. When talking about private property rights over land, this policy has been implemented in the form of titling projects, under the assumption that titles signal secure land tenure. I question the presumption that titles are equivalent to secure tenure and consequently shift the focus of study to the issue of land tenure security: under what economic conditions do we expect land tenure insecurity, what are the real means to attain tenure security, and what is the effect of secure tenure on resource use. The research is done in the Ucayali region of Peruvian Amazonia to further assess the relevance to titling projects to address problems of environmental degradation. Results show the importance of institutional constraints, in the form of regulations regarding access to land, in the way land tenure is secure in Amazonian. These regulations imply the dissipation of rents and resource degradation to secure tenure, and the relative irrelevance to title for it. To assess the effect of secure tenure on resource use, econometric analysis was performed using the Peruvian National Survey of Rural Households (ENAHR), done in 1984. In shaping resource use, characteristics of farmers, farm size, and market conditions prove more important than tenure security in the form of title.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio",

    "description": "63 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1997.This experiment extends work on group versus individual performance to a new type of induction task; examines effects of ambiguity, information, and instruction on task performance and confidence; and tests the task against the social combination model of a theory of collective induction. Four-person groups and four independent individuals tried to identify works of art of varying abstraction by progressively removing masking pieces over a series of trials. Although the task had a correct answer, the artwork title, the title had to be induced rather than demonstrated over nine trials. Also, because of the subjective perspective that many assume when dealing with the art domain, the task could be approached as a judgment rather than a demonstrable correct-answer problem. Group and individual performance did not differ significantly. Competitive tests of social combination models indicated that the model described by a theory of collective induction (Laughlin & Hollingshead, 1995) fit the probabilities of group hypotheses for distributions of member hypotheses and group selections of masking pieces for distributions of member masking piece preferences. The predictions of five other models could be rejected for both hypotheses and piece selections. On post-task questions groups reported more confidence in their performance, whereas individuals reported more interest and motivation to do the task.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

Each chapter addresses these contexts as sites of negotiation for battered lesbians whose narratives of abuse indicate vast injustices from traditional support systems and their own communities.

    "description": "302 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1987.Business and industry have long recognized the importance of studying employee turnover as a measure of organizational health. Unfortunately, libraries have been slow to recognize the importance of studying this type of employee movement. The purpose of this study is to begin the process of analyzing turnover in public libraries by systematically collecting, summarizing, and analyzing turnover activity in selected public libraries in the Midwest. Emphasis in this study is placed in two areas: (1) establishing base-line data on turnover rates for public libraries; and (2) analyzing differences in turnover rates and turnover behavior based on gender.Data were obtained from a sample of thirty-one public libraries and 421 individual turnovers for a period beginning January 1, 1980, and ending December 31, 1984. The data gathered for individual turnovers included gender, tenure, age, salary, marital status, possession of a master's degree in library science, job title, reason for leaving and destination after quitting. The data gathered for the institutions included size of staff, number of hires (both male and female), whether an employee union was present, service population, budget per capita, percent of budget spent on personnel, and beginning salary.The data revealed that the turnover rates of full time librarians are low compared to other professions. In addition, no statistical difference in the turnover rates of males and females could be found. This finding is not consistent with the stereotype that females have higher turnover rates due to the conflicting demands of job and family. Analysis of the reasons why employees leave does suggest that females are more likely to leave their jobs for family reasons than their male counterparts, but that overall, their rate of leaving is no greater than males. Similarly, analysis revealed that gender is not a good predictor of why librarians leave their jobs.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",

    "description": "196 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1980.Overlap (when two libraries own the same title) and duplication (when one library has more than one copy of a book) in children's collections were measured in two elementary school libraries and the public library in each of four Illinois communities (population approximately 30,000). Two hundred book titles were randomly selected from the shelf lists of the libraries and lists were compiled of magazines, science filmstrips, and fiction sound recordings. The relationship between collection size and overlap is linear and positively correlated. There is less overlap between two school libraries than between a school and a public library. As titles are listed in more selection aids, those titles are included in more library collections. Although there is little duplication, those titles included in the collections of more than one library are more likely to be duplicated. The patterns of overlap and duplication detected for books are also present in the audiovisual materials studied. Librarian's perceptions of the library collections, as shown by responses on a questionnaire, usually agree with the patterns detected for those collections. Collection development does not seem to be a carefully planned process. More similarities than differences were discovered between school and public library children's collections. The method developed in this study to measure overlap and duplication could be used by individual communities to aid in collection development and self-study.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD",
